Was this\\nintended? From reading the description of the data, I thought this dataset was\\nsupposed to include data for all warehouses.\\n\\n\\n## 3 Comments\\n\\n\\n### [MichalKecera](/mkecera)\\nHi [@yantxx](https://www.kaggle.com/yantxx),  \\nGood catch. Thanks. This is now corrected - it has all the warehouses.\\n\\n\\n### [Yan Teixeira](/yantxx)\\n[@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) I have another quick question\\nBudapest_1 is the only warehouse with a latest date of 2024-03-14, whereas all\\nthe other warehouses have a latest date of 2024-03-15. The first date for all\\nwarehouses in the test set is 2024-03-16, which makes me think that the\\ntraining data might be missing the 2024-03-15 data for Budapest.\\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-\\nattachments/o/inbox%2F13062964%2Ffc26ef9639b3c309efea6bd0f3d99b51%2Fwarehouses.png?generation=1717963982169724&alt=media)\\n\\n\\n### [MichalKecera](/mkecera)\\nHi [@yantxx](https://www.kaggle.com/yantxx) 2024-03-15 was a public holiday in\\nBudapest - the warehouse was not open.\\n\\n\\n### [Yan Teixeira](/yantxx)\\n[@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) Can you share a MAPE benchmark for\\none or more models that Rohlik uses?\\n\\n\\n### [MichalKecera](/mkecera)\\n[@yantxx](https://www.kaggle.com/yantxx) yes, we will do it in a few weeks.\\n',\n",

This method involves duplicating the order data from the year 2023 and joining it with the training data, aligning by day of the year and day of the week.

The effectiveness is attributed to the limitations in using data to predict daily order variations, such as weather or past orders, leaving weekends and holidays as the primary predictable factors which exhibit yearly similarity.

A simple model may be sufficient if the data is small and the goal is to achieve a basic level of accuracy.
