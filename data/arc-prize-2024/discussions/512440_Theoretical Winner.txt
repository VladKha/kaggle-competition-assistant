### Theoretical Winner
I'm trying to square the economics with the nature of this contest. AGI will
usher in a multi-trillion dollar industry. If I _use_ AGI to enter and win, I
will get a share of… one million dollars? But my code will be published. So it
will be in the public domain. AGI will be online, free for the taking. But
that's cool, because I'll have $600,000 in my pocket. So I code and "train"
something. And this thing scores 95% on the public ARC test. Now what? Of
course, I enter and WIN! Then what? There are no guarantees other than the
aforementioned fraction of a million. You see the uncomfortable position one
would find oneself in, should one have a high degree of confidence in one's
own AGI process.

To be fair, if you do win, a top notch research firm will probably pick you up
if you truly find something groundbreaking. The big three that won imagenet in
2012 sold their "company" (aka talent) to Google for $45 million.
On top of this, that's kinda the name of the research game. The people who
build Unix, HTTP, or hell even discovered the transistor I don't think made
Bill Gates level money, even though they all make a multi-trillion dollar tech
economy hum.

First get 85 or more on the LB, and after that decide whether to open source
your solution or not?
PS: My personal opinion is that it is extremely difficult to even reach 60 in
this competition.

Agreed on both points. But imagine scoring 85. You're almost guaranteed to win
top prize with that. And then everybody gets to see all the code you wrote. So
while you're shaking hands and paying your mortgage off, the trillion dollar
industry is starting behind your back. It is starting because of your code.  
All I'm saying is, run it through one more time… See what the next word in the
sentence is.
If you submit your 85+ entry, it will win. And according to the agreement, it
will become open source.

I imagine one _could_ "clean" ones code of most of the relevant IP, and still
submit and possibly even win. working…

Even solving 85+ on this competition isn’t guaranteed to be the missing link
for AGI. If anything this competition highlights current limitations of state
of the art transformer models and is trying to incentivise exploration instead
of hyper exploitation and compute scaling. I think solving ARC will be just
one more step towards AGI, not the final one
