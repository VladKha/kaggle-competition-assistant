### Submission time notebook error with GPU
Hi, I'm new here, and any help would be greatly appreciated.
I'm using llama 3.1 8b-instruct as a baseline on the ARC challenge. My setup
is:
  * notebook with dual T4 GPUs
  * llama 3.1 8b instruct [from the model file](https://www.kaggle.com/models/metaresearch/llama-3.1)
  * simple reading, prompting, and writing to submission.json
The code runs fine when I'm testing and committing, the submission.json file
is produced. But when I "Submit Prediction", after a few minutes I get:  
**Notebook Threw Exception**
The code is essentially just:
    
    
    model_id = "/kaggle/input/llama-3.1/transformers/8b-instruct/2"
    
    pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
        "text-generation",
        model=model_id,
        model_kwargs={"torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16},
        device_map="auto",
    )
    
    test_challenges_path = '../input/arc-prize-2024/arc-agi_test_challenges.json'
    with open(test_challenges_path) as fp:
        test_challenges = json.load(fp)
    
    for key, task in tqdm.tqdm(test_challenges.items()):        
        try:
            messages = [ #these are different in my code, so that the output is a python list of lists
                {"role": "system", "content": "you are ARC solver"},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"solve ARC problem {task}"},
            ]
    
            outputs = pipeline(messages, max_new_tokens=256)
            prediction1 = eval(outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1]) #this produces a list of lists
        except:
            prediction1 = []
    
        submission[key] = [{'attempt_1': prediction1, 'attempt_2': prediction1}]
    
    with open('submission.json', 'w') as fp:
        json.dump(submission, fp)
    
    
    content_copy
Any help on how to debug or resolve this would be much appreciated.
For example, do you know what GPU the Submission is running on?
