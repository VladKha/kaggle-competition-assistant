### Error submissions should not be counted
Submission counts are to prevent leakages. There are no leakages on errored
submissions. Tried 2 submissions that errored and decided to just use
<https://www.kaggle.com/code/ironbar/minimal-submission> to see if that works.
It does and now I can not retry for 24 hours.
Btw, there seems to be no difference between my output structure and the
minimal one. The only difference may be I used input path of '../input/…'
instead of '/kaggle/input/…'. Even if this isn't the reason for the error, the
default Notebook comment says to use '../input/…' , yet the code right under
it is '/kaggle/input/…'.
Very frustrating. Especially when the error doesn't even show my
submission.json. Maybe it doesn't because the code didn't produce any? Anyone
knows if it is shown if one is produced?

You can use the type of error to probe the test data. That is why, error
submissions are also counted.

Also, check out my "Weird Errors" post. neoneye has some great suggestions to
keep the errors low.

I had a similar issue last week. I probably should have shared what I learned.
Scroll to the bottom of the page and you'll see "Input" Output" "Logs"… Like
you, I assumed that errors would show up someplace like submission.json, or
even output. But the error output is under Logs. It was such a duh moment, I
kept it to myself.
