### Why only public leaderboard
The weakest part of the last competition in my opinion was that the public
leaderboard was on the full test set. That is the reason there were a ton of
uninteresting solutions doing hit and trial/probing to guess the test puzzles.
I've read Francois' post that probing the leaderboard is against the spirit of
the competition, and I agree. However, competitors will always optimize for
the incentives setup for them. The incentive with all the test set being on
public leaderboard is to probe and overfit. With a private leaderboard
everyone is forced to try and generalize. Hope future iterations take this
into account.

Thanks for the comments! We are learning along the way too.
All solutions are subject to review. Probing/trialing the leaderboard will
show itself in submission history and potentially overfitting for the
solutions.
Given that the search space is large for the private evaluation set and no
feedback is given other than the score we expect this won't happen.

I'm not saying probing/guessing is very easy or successful, but participants
in the previous competition did it anyway, because that's the incentive when
there's no private leaderboard.

[@dipamc77](https://www.kaggle.com/dipamc77) you are right and adding to the
point, it will easily overfit the private leaderboard

[@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt) "All solutions are subject
to review." What exactly does this mean? Does it mean the probing solution
won't be allowed or that there are restrictions on probing? Of course probing
with multiple accounts is not allowed, but are there any limits for probing on
your own? "potentially overfitting for the solutions" This won't be an issue
for probers since there is not second test set?

The limits to probing on your own (which in general probing is discouraged but
we know it will happen) are the normal 5 submissions a day w/ normal Kaggle
rules.

I am wondering what was the motivation not to create two separate test sets
from the beginning. It is the first time I see a competition on Kaggle with
the public leaderboard covering 100% of the test set.
