I think [@alexis1024](https://www.kaggle.com/alexis1024) is correct. You could
run a small sample and test it against this scoring function which will tell
you if it is the correct format or not
<https://www.kaggle.com/code/gregkamradt/arc-prize-scoring>
You can also look at the submission.json that is default when the notebook
loads to make sure you are using the same format there.

I think you output only one test case for each task, some tasks have several
input test cases you can check my dummy sumbmission
<https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexis1024/empty-successful-submission/>  
also you might want to have a try/catch and fall back to a empty answer with
the write format, just to check if you have a python error somewhere
