### [propose] Split Estimate Reasoning & Answer Image
Hi ! I propose **Split 'Estimate Reasoning' & 'Answer Image' Model
Architecture**


## Propose
![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-
attachments/o/inbox%2F21738685%2Fec4ebf804db85f0b25eceda3ecc81c23%2F2.png?generation=1726323737438529&alt=media)
the architecture is intended
  * improve more stability of reasoning from samples on same challenge
  * explicitly conditional image generation


## Discussion
~~Most of the problems were solved by looking at two samples, so I think two
samples are sufficient for Estimate Reasoning.~~  
Referring to "[A wrong sample?](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-
prize-2024/discussion/536066)", it seems that I need to modify the model.
