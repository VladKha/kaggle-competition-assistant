### Speed Comparison of Open weighted LLMs
Refer to ARC Prize 2024 Competition:  
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024/>
For this competition, its very important to choose the LLMs which perform best
in terms of  
task completion. I found the following recent IEEE Computer publication as a
useful reference.  
-J. Conde, et al.,"Speed and Conversational Large Language Models: Not All Is About Tokens per Second" in Computer, vol. 57, no. 08, pp. 74-80, 2024.  
doi: 10.1109/MC.2024.3399384  
<https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/co/2024/08/10632720/1ZgY6ndKCTm>  
The paper compares the open weighted LLMs such as LLama 2/3, Mistral, Gemma
and Yi.  
Hope the participants in this competition find this article useful while
selecting LLMs.
