### 42 ‼️ The answer to the ultimate question?
I don't see any discussion on the latest score is 42 by MindsAI. That's a big
jump! Any details on the approach?

I think they start with a **_really hot_** cup of tea…

MIT CSail has several papers and code online. I've read them, played with
their code but I think they've hit a wall, hence all the entries. It's very
cool stuff, I stumbled on it when I was digging through papers looking for
ideas
Edit: Almost all the really big progress in AI has come from; more data +
GPUs, or, dusting off old algorithms and updating them. I've a book of dozens
of old AI algorithms from the 1980s I'm going to start trying late this week.
If you're looking for small models for small data you might also start looking
backwards

Could you provide links to some of the papers you found interesting? I search
for MIT CSail and ARC, but I didn't find much.

I was searching for Bayesian, few shot learning and generative and stumbled on
the papers, code. You can download it, play with it and adapt it work on this
dataset.
The group of best scores in the previous contest all used reasoning type
systems like John McCarthy etc used in the 1970s? 60s?

They've been pretty mum about techniques, other than a couple of the
interviews they've given. Notice their high number of submissions. Because
this contest has no private leaderboard (what you see is what you get on the
final score), it allows a very effective strategy of trying different methods.
Since you need an exact answer to score a point on each example, you can't
simply guess. But you can try many different methods and see which work. For
example, in a week you can try 3x7=21 new methods and and see which solve more
of the problems.

There are more… 'precise' techniques.
