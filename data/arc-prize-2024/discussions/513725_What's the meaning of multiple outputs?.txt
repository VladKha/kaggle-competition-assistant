### What's the meaning of multiple outputs?
Hi guys, the description page says that "Most tasks only have a single output
(a single dictionary enclosed in a list), although some tasks have multiple
outputs that must be predicted."
But I didn't find any multiple output example in datasets. Is there anything I
missed?

Here are the tasks with multiple output in `arc-agi_training_challenges.json`:
task id | number of test  
---|---  
239be575 | 2  
25ff71a9 | 2  
27a28665 | 3

Hi, I checked the task ff28f65a, the output is a 3x3 matrix, it is seems not a
multiple output. What does "len" mean in your table?

The 3x3 matrix should enclosed in a list, even if single output. Maybe you
copy pasted example EDA code that only looks at first entry.
Not at my computer, but if I remember right, it would be something like:  
single_output_oops = all_train_solutions[task_id]['test'][0]
Take the parsed json, and make sure you go one level deeper at a time.

I updated my comment, "len"->number of test.  
For example the task ff28f65a has 3test, that mean 3(test_input, solution)
pairs.  
For each task, we must output a solution for each test_input
