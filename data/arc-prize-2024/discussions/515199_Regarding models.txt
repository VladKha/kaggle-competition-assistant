Dear organizer, is it necessary to use AI based models? Can we use simple
python based algorithms instead and win the prize?

Usually, you would end up in a combinatorial explosion but sure why not?
Anything that works at the human-level would be disruptive! Good luck ðŸ˜Š

It's not necessary at all, the point of this competition is to explore
alternative methods to AGI besides LLMs. I imagine you should be able to
approach the problem however you want.
