### Submission Scoring Error
"Your notebook generated a submission file with incorrect format. Some
examples causing this are: wrong number of rows or columns, empty values, an
incorrect data type for a value, or invalid submission values from what is
expected. See more debugging tips"
I get this message everytime when i trying to submit my notebook code. How i
should change my submission file to make it correct?

everything looks fine to me, also verified with json file integrity checker.
if you find the problem please update.

Also getting this error annoyingly, have lost ~8 submissions to it. I imagine
that there's not really a way for anyone to really help as I'm sure it's
submission-specific, but if anyone has some tips, would appreciate it. Pretty
sure that it's not due to an error in the pipeline and the initial JSON
generated on the test set doesn't have any glaring issues.
