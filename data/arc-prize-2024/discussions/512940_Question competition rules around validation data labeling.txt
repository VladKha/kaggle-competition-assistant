### Question competition rules around validation data labeling
Hi! I noticed the following statement in the rules:
> Submissions may not use or incorporate information from hand labeling or
> human prediction of the validation dataset or test data records.
I wanted to clarify what this means in practice. A common approach so far
seems to be to derive DSL rules from the existing training and validation
examples, like the 2020 winning solution (which had the same rule):
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/abstraction-and-reasoning-
challenge/discussion/154597>
So just to make sure: labeling evaluation data, like extracting DSL rules
and/or training a model on those, is still permitted for the ARC prize 2024,
right?

The key part here is
> validation dataset or test data records.
The intent of this line is to say the private test set can not be used. Only a
very small number of non-contestants have access to it which makes this a non-
issue for contestants.

Is the public test set not the validation dataset?

Dear organizer, is it necessary to use AI models? Can we use simple python
based algorithms instead and win the prize?

They've said several times that you can use any approach you like - indeed
they actively encourage a diversity of approaches.
