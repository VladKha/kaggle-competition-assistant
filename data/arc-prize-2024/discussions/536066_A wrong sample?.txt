### A wrong sample?
Maybe this was discussed already, let me know if that's the case.
I believe that train input and output are swapped in the second pair of
d2acf2cb, see below. What do you think?

A common mistake. Previously, they found a few and fixed them.
([1](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024/discussion/512962),
[2](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024/discussion/513114))
This one must have been overlooked.

Who is "they" and where are the previous fixes?

"They" are probably the 23 contributors to <https://github.com/fchollet/ARC-
AGI> , which is where you can find all previous fixes. MMMV.

It was partially answered above, but I meant the organizers of the competition
(in point 2), one of whom is François Chollet -

My personal assumption is that it's a symmetric transformation and it goes
both ways.

Then why only one example, seems odd. But you are right totally possible.

Also… usually the "odd man out" is the third, and the test (which would
parallel the misfit) is the fourth. This task would break with that. That is
one stylish avatar, btw. :-)

Hi, [@fchollet](https://www.kaggle.com/fchollet)
[@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt) is this intentional or an
error?
