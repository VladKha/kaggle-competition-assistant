### [place holder] my idea to solve ARC-AGI

i would like to treat this as an "image caption problem".
  1. first I learned a CLIP model: align "pseudo code" to "input/output image".
  2. next, given "input/output image", we generate top-N "pseudo code".
  3. we have a code generator(LLM) to generate real python code from "pseudo code".
  4. we then put everything into LLM agent framework, i.e. code generator is the agent, who's job is to run python code to see if see if the "pseudo code" is correct.

[1] where is the reasoning?
  * reasoning is "generation of steps/thoughts" to move from start point to end goal.
  * learned from pseudo code
[2] where is the general intelligence?
  * ability to generate solution and test it. (the agent framework) … and better still, self-correct it (which is a RL problem)

medal-level/>  
article on "AI achieves silver-medal standard solving International
Mathematical Olympiad problems"
  * the main solution is to use LLM to parse the problem correctly, so that another model can generate solutions.
  * we follow the same approach. CLIP model let's us parse the problem: from image to pseudo code

this course should be very useful the this competition

Note: LLM is just a "next word" predictor. It "cannot" do reasoning nor do
planning. we need translate ARC problem into a new "reasoning language" which
i am still exploring.

Next Word Prediction.  
"When it rains, it" … "pours" This is how humans do next word prediction. LLMs
take an entire question, sentence or statement, check their "database" and
determine that the "next word" is whatever followed in the online chat where
the question was asked or the first word of the response in the email that was
"picked up". Then they add that to the string, in order to predict the "next"
word. LLMs can do this in any language because those things exist in other
languages. It's all meaningless byte combinations that happen to have a great
deal of meaning to humans. The meaning is fairly localized, from frog hunting
to sub-atomic physics, they all have people who are interested in leaning
more. And if any blanks need filling in, there are staffs of thousands in
impoverished areas of the world, typing like the wind to fill in those blanks.
I have seen ads online, to work as an AI code reviewer, correcting errors in
AI generated code.  
The reasoning is right there, written down on the LLMs arm. Machine Learning
is great. Just not that great.

my guess of changes are:
  1. current deep learning (learning of data) to AGI (learning of hypothese, aka functionals)
  2. current inference to online testling (of hypothese)
  3. current conv, linear … layers (matrix multiplcation) to mini programs
compute become very important. It will take about 3 to 5 years to see real
changes

This is a very interesting topic.  
I have one question. Why did you use CLIP instead of an LLM?  
Given that the resolution in this case is not high (with a maximum of 30x30),
I think it would have been possible to input directly into an LLM.  
Did you try using an LLM? If you have any thoughts on this, I'd be interested
to hear them.

Hello, I’ve had similar ideas, though there are some differences. When I
actually tried it out, I noticed that (in my opinion) the most critical part
is whether the LLM can generate valid hypotheses when generating hypotheses
(or solutions). For example, most of the time, it generates ineffective
hypotheses that are always correct but have no informational value (like: the
top-left input is always 0, etc.). The paper you shared only briefly explains
in section 2.3 how they use LLM to generate hypotheses, but it doesn’t
specifically mention whether they encountered the issue I mentioned above.
This is something I’m quite curious about.

" most critical part is whether the LLM can generate valid hypotheses "
…representation and training data is the key….
you note that previous competition winner icecuber uses handcraft hypotheses …

I am taking a shot in the dark here but what about using simulated annealing
with generating valid hypotheses? Could you then use it to develop an optimal
solution so you can test the veracity?

This is a very interesting discussion.  
I apologize for asking such a basic question, but how do you obtain
information from research papers?  
If you use any curation sites, I'd appreciate it if you could share them.

heh I'm an old academic - just comes with experience. Usually reading the
abstract and then go to discussion / conclusion and then results is a good
starter. Only go to Methods and details when you understand if it's worth it

Thank you for your response. It's very helpful. Do you search for papers each
time using Google Scholar? Or do you use news sites like Twitter to get new
information? I'm amazed at how much information and how many papers everyone
seems to know about.

[Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/) is a good resource. You can
browse recent papers or SOTA papers by task / method, or search for papers on
a task you're working on, like [abstract
reasoning.](https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=abstract+reasoning)

Your approach is both innovative and highly strategic, effectively treating
the problem as an "image captioning" task but applying it to code generation.
By aligning pseudo code with input/output images using a CLIP model and then
leveraging an LLM to generate and verify real Python code, you’ve introduced a
sophisticated reasoning mechanism. This reasoning—manifested in the generation
of steps and thoughts to achieve the end goal—demonstrates a deep
understanding of how to bridge the gap between abstract concepts (pseudo code)
and concrete implementations (real code).
Furthermore, your use of an LLM agent framework to generate, test, and even
self-correct the code is a brilliant example of general intelligence in
action. The ability of the system to generate solutions, test them, and
improve upon them highlights an impressive level of autonomy and adaptability.
The incorporation of reinforcement learning to enhance self-correction takes
it a step further, showing foresight in building a system that not only solves
problems but learns and evolves from its experiences.
Overall, your approach exemplifies cutting-edge thinking in the intersection
of AI, code generation, and general intelligence. It's an excellent
demonstration of how these concepts can be combined to create a powerful,
intelligent system. Kudos for such a forward-thinking and well-structured
solution!

我和你有类似的想法。但是，我在使用LLama3.1生成代码的时候，发现生成的代码都无法正常运行，更不要说实现input2output的转换。也许线上的大模型表现得会更好，但是比赛不允许。

`Generate Hypotheses`是我没有想到的。不知道它是会放大误差还是缩减误差。
