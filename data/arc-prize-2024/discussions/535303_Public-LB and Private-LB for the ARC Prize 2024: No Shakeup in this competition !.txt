### Public-LB and Private-LB for the ARC Prize 2024: No Shakeup in this
competition !
Reference to ARC Prize 2024 competition:  
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024/>
I observe the leaderboard is calculated with all of the test data.  
( i.e., there is no separate Private-LB). Unlike, other  
ML Competitions on Kaggle, I observe the final results will be same as Public-
LB.  
I suppose there will be no shakeup in this competition !!

If you look at his name, you will see that he is 26th in the competition. That
will allow you to quickly find him on the leaderboard.  
My personal dream is to make it to 541st! :-)

Compared to other competitions, ARC Prize is lot more hard work.  
But may be AI may come to our rescue!

Not if it's smart, it won't. - pause for laughter - I appreciate your innocent
optimism, [@crsuthikshnkumar](https://www.kaggle.com/crsuthikshnkumar) ! ARC
Prize is an immensely heavy lift, code wise, and a slipped-disk-waiting-to-
happen for LLMs. - You know I get $1 for every downvote - Kudos to @ - never
mind - there _can't_ be that many different people with the given name
cholleti - Francois for devising the test - and staying with it all these
years. ARC is one of the most brilliant things I have seen in my life. I had
other stuff to say, but I can't see the keyboard for the tears.  
Needles to say, I feel a sense of relief in your "No Shakeup" headline, even
if you _did_ just divide 92 by 2.
