### Pretraining
I was hoping someone can clarify the requirement that "External data, freely &
publicly available, is allowed, including pre-trained models".
I would like to pre-train a model as part of my solution and use that pre-
trained model in my submission. However, I would prefer not to make that model
public until after the competition closes.
Is this acceptable?

I believe that is very acceptable if not every non program synthesis approach
is doing so.
