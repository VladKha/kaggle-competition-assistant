### Using Docker from Jupyter notebook
Hi
I have a partial solution to ARC-AGI.
I need to use a docker image to run my code in (it's written in Rust). Does
anyone know how to run a docker image (I have one locally with Rust
installed)? How does one install then communicate between Jupyter and the
docker container to compile and run binary code having copied appropriate
training files across. Then pull back results for submission?
Docker command does not seem to be available from Jupyter notebook.
Help would be very much appreciated.

Okay, there is a solution. Docker is only for emulating the Kaggle
environment. However, it can be used to create a shared object version of the
code (a simple binary executable is not allowed). The shared object can be
called from python with cffi. So, create a shared object, upload it, link to
it with cffi and it will work. Clunky! In case anyone else is not a fan of
Python and prefers a full fat language. Note, currently about 10% of the cases
work with the evaluation data set, the Rust code takes about 2 seconds to run
and generate the results. At worst, this will scale linearly with additional
cases (currently adding 2 or 3 a day).
