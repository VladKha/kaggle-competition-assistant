Wish list:  
An intro video to ARC-AGI for regular people. Why these puzzles? How do you
solve a puzzle?

I happen to be married to a wonderful regular person, with a relatively high
IQ who laughs at all of my jokes, and I have gently nudged her toward trying
ARC. She's not a tech geek, like me, but "She can geek. She geeks. She'll
geek." Only she has so many "well, WHY?" style responses that I've never had
that Christmas morning moment of walking away while she gets hooked. It's like
she doesn't even like the smell. And I know that there are plenty of folks
with even shorter attention spans and less tolerance for figuring things out.
In short, regular people just might not _like_ the corpus. MMMV.
