### My perspective on this challenge, feedback appreciated
Hi everyone!
I've been pondering the limitations of machine learning, which relies heavily
on making predictions based on past data. This raises an important question:
where is the room for novel, unique solutions to problems?
Limiting our reliance on past data while exploring new and innovative ways to
approach problems is, in my opinion, the most critical focus area. As I delve
deeper into this topic, I've come to realize that relying solely on past data
to predict the future is a more perilous issue in Gen AI than I initially
thought.
As I delve deeper into this area, I've come to realize that relying solely on
past data to predict the future is a more perilous issue in general AI than I
initially thought. There may be multiple ways to solve a particular problem,
but all of these approaches rely on existing data. The adage 'The solution is
in the problem' suggests that the answer lies within the problem itself, but I
believe there's a fundamental flaw in this statement. I'd like to illustrate
this point with an example from the job applicant context:
If a job applicant analysis system only accepts candidates based on the
existing data of profiles who performed well, there's a negligence towards job
profiles that deviate from those who did well. As humans, it's common sense to
recognize how flawed this system is, and I think this problem is pervasive in
everything else related to Gen AI.
Are we tackling exactly this problem in this challenge? I know we are trying
to generalize gen AI.
Any resources to look into this specific area would be greatly appreciated.
