### Is the size of the test output known or do we predict it?
  * I realized that the test input and output do not always have the same size.
  * Does this mean we have to predict the size of the test output before filling it with the right values?

Yes, we should predict the shape of the test output for each test input
(before filling this test output with the right values).

Then the competition is way harder than I thought

Sort of… A good chunk (the majority) of input matrices equal the outputs in
size. Still dang hard to figure out, but at least the size part is easy.
Another chunk of the tasks have size changes that are extremely easy to
analyze (i.e. every example starts at 3x3 and outputs to 9x9). Only a few of
the tasks have output sizings (and other details) that are based on "little
gimmicks", like if the input object is red, the output matrix is a certain
size; but it's a different size if the input object is blue. Some of these
gimmicks are downright difficult for humans, so good luck getting - insert LLM
here - to get it right.
