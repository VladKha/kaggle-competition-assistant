### What is the official stance on discussing the challenges?
I have found a few mistakes in the area of tiny details, and made a few errors
in understanding what I was looking at. What I would like to say is, "Is that
right? It doesn't look right" in the discussion board, and without any real
need to divulge solutions, someone else could either say, "Just keep working
on it. I solved it, so it's probably not a mistake," or, "Say, that does look
wrong." The latter would be a critical-mass builder toward creating a Github
Issue, and the former would be equally helpful. I am uninclined to behave
thus, without first checking with the powers that be. Freedom to chat at that
level would be a potential time saver. Feedback?

You can say anything and talk in any level of detail here on the forums -
including sharing your entire solution if you want. Anything discussed on the
forums is considered public discussion, so it's all ok. The relevant line from
the rules is:
> It's okay to share code if made available to all participants on the forums.
What's _not_ ok is if you were to privately discuss your solution (with code)
with someone and ask if it looks ok (unless they are already on your team).
(Also, as an aside, that rule is specifically about code and data sharing; I
think there's been some gray lines in the past about what constitutes "code or
data" sharing vs just "talking about the problem", but you'll always be ok if
you use the forum to talk about it)

That makes a lot of sense! Thanks for the clarity.
