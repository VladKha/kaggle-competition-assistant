### Can we use data augmentation?
Hi everyone, sorry for the basic question, but I am new to kaggle. I just
wanted to know if it is ok for this competition if we train the models with
artifitial tests cases that we create?
Thanks!!!

Yep, you can! You can use any model you'd like for the official competition as
long as it doesn't require internet.  
And of course respect all legal requirements and licenses for the model you
choose (a non-factor if you do your own)

sorry, follow up question. Let's say I create 100k test cases and I want to
use them to train or fine-tune a model. Does the time for creation and fine-
tuning count for the 12h limit, or I can train them beforehand and this time
limit just apply for inference?
