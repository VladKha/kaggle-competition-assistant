Learning Abductive Reasoning using VSA Distributed Representations

<https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19121> Learning Abductive Reasoning using VSA
Distributed Representations
We introduce the Abductive Rule Learner with Context-awareness (ARLC), a model
that solves abstract reasoning tasks based on Learn-VRF.  
ARLC features a novel and more broadly applicable training objective for
abductive reasoning, resulting in better interpretability and higher accuracy
when solving Raven's progressive matrices (RPM).  
ARLC allows both programming domain knowledge and learning the rules
underlying a data distribution. We evaluate ARLC on the I-RAVEN dataset,
showcasing state-of-the-art accuracy across both in-distribution and out-of-
distribution (unseen attribute-rule pairs) tests.  
ARLC surpasses neuro-symbolic and connectionist baselines, including large
language models, despite having orders of magnitude fewer parameters.  
We show ARLC's robustness to post-programming training by incrementally
learning from examples on top of programmed knowledge, which only improves its
performance and does not result in catastrophic forgetting of the programmed
solution.  
We validate ARLC's seamless transfer learning from a 2x2 RPM constellation to
unseen constellations. Our code is available at this https URL.

Solves I-Raven IQ tests with 88% score, and demonstrates ability to generalize
inferred rules & patterns to similar but unseen situations. They mentioned
Chollet's ARC as a future research direction for this project.
**Pros:**  
Learn from all train samples simultaneously  
88% score  
**Cons:**  
Learn spurious rules in some cases  
No consistency (sharing) of rules learned across train samples  
Bad performance in case of multiple shapes / colored groups  
Only 3x3 grids ie 2 train rows + 1 test row
