It is hard to believe that next token prediction _alone_ can effectively solve
the reasoning problems that exist in ARC.
IMHO I agree with what Subbarao Kambhampati said in [Can Large Language Models
Reason and Plan?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04121v2):
"What LLM do armed with web-scale training, is a form of universal approximate
retrieval, which, as I have argued, can sometimes be mistaken for reasoning
capabilities."

I would also advise looking at AlphaProof it is also a strategy that could
help for this competition!
