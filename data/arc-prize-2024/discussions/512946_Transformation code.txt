### Transformation code
I am not sure if I am understanding this challenge correctly. Do we need to
write the code to do the transformations (e.g. resize, crop, move objects etc)
or does the code exist already somewhere?

You need to do it yourself (or use a model that does it). There is some code
examples made public from the previous competition

Yes that would be a good example of a starting place. You could also take a
look at solutions from 2020 as inspiration
