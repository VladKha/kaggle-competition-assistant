### How to utilize LLMs?
I want to utilize LLMs to solve this ARC problem, but don't know how.
**My understanding**  
[[Template] Llama 3 8b ARC Prize 2024
inference](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hansuelijud/template-llama-3-8b-arc-
prize-2024-inference) is a good starter code.  
So, my current opinion is that LLMs are used for coding generation by
prompting and main focus of this competition is fintuning the LLMs.
**Question**
  1. is this understanding correct?
  2. Is there any useful tips, websites, or past competitions for using LLMs in the ARC task?

Thanks in advance.

Regarding question 1, the main focus of the competition is not really fine-
tuning LLMs but rather to come up with any approach that solves ARC.  
In case you go with an LLM based approach, then I would say that fine-tuning
is a really important part of the approaching solving ARC.
