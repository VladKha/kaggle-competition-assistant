### Can offline Trained LLMs be used in the competition?
I would like to know if training LLMs with P100 GPUs provided is slow, can we
train the LLMs on personal GPU server and upload, if this vialoates the rule
"not access to the Internet"? E.g. We just use inference with LLMs on the
kaggle notebook

Yes, it is allowed. There is no access to the internet, but public datasets
are allowed, one can transfer pre-trained model weights through it, and it is
explicitly stated in the description. If you worry about sharing the weights
to not let your competitors learn your approach, you can just do it during the
last days of the competition, not leaving time to meaningfully react.
