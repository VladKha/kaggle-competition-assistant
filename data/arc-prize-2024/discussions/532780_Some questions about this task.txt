### Some questions about this task
I am new here and I find this task is interesting. It demands more gerenral
learning for logical inference to some extend based on my superficial
understanding.But I am still puzzled with something.
Let's take instance '007bbfb7' (the first one)as the example, it seems that we
should predict the test input based on train pairs which contain some logical
laws. Example '007bbfb7' only contains 0 and 7 while some other examples
contain more numbers. I am wondering that whether the meanings of ’7‘ in all
the examples are the same or each number in specific example is just a general
symbol and it can be replaced by other numbers which are not repeated. To be
more specific,  
1）in instance '007bbfb7', can I replace all ’7‘s by ’2‘, '3' or some others
else?  
2) both instances ’017c7c7b‘ and '0520fde7' contain ’2‘, are they different
exactly? Only the same numbers denote the same meaning inside a independent
instance while different among all instances.

The IDs are basically random hex values between (approx.) `0x10 0000` and `0x1
0000 0000`. There is no real requirement to alter them in any sense, and
probably all kinds of foolish errors would result from so doing. Best of luck
with the harder parts!

Les IDS représentent tout simplement les références ou keys pour chaque
séquence d'I/O d'entrainement et de test .  
Bonne chance

I don't think that the sample id bears any useful information.

I wondered a little about relative time stamp, possible human connection (i.e.
all of Chollet's creations are modulo 13 == 0), potential categorical details,
other cryptominutiae. But no - no role in Machine Learning, AFAIK.
