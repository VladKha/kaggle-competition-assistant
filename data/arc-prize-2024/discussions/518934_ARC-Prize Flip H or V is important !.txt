I see you've been roundly down-voted for this post and your other very similar
post. A few suggestions for starting more helpful discussions…
  * If you think it's important (which you state in your title), show why. For example, what do you score without using this technique and what do you score when you add this technique in? How many of the test cases need this technique to solve them?
  * This particular idea already appears in basically all the existing notebooks. What novel ideas do you have? Or how does your contribution here improve on the existing versions?
  * Perhaps give the exclamation mark a miss. I'm sure this is an exciting discovery for you, but it's better to let the idea speak for itself.
