### AI solution levels
Hello.
Can my development model be used for this AI model development? Probably it
could bring new ideas and be useful. I think achievement of level 2.4 is Ok.
It includes self-improvement (2.2), mutations (2.3), and detection of the best
solution (2.4 - innovations). Does Python have the appropriate libraries or
does it require low-level code development of absent functionality? Or it is a
question of developing an appropriate framework? I would appreciate your
comments.
# A look at AI solutions (AIS) development levels based on SLMHM
See the reference at the end of the article for what SLMHM is.


## Pattern 1. Structure
This is a pattern of knowledge. It is a level of modern AI models.
1.1. Desire. The purpose of AIS.  
1.2. Intention. Function leading to AIS development/learning. For example, it
can be reinforcement learning or other.  
1.3. Feasibility. Algorithm, software, hardware, data.  
1.4. Action. Running and getting results.


## Pattern 2. Intelligence
This is a pattern of self-development models. It is the level of general AI
models.
2.1. Evaluation. AIS can evaluate what is OK and what is Not OK as the
minimum. It includes the evaluation of not only data but also the AI model
itself.  
2.2. Improvement. AIS can improve itself.  
2.3. Alternatives. AIS can generate/evaluate alternatives to be used for its
improvement.  
2.4. Innovations. Here is the level where innovations can be detected.
Innovations should be able to be detected.


## Pattern 3. Connectivity
This is a pattern of AI models capable of developing interactions with the
environment.
3.1. Reward. AIS can evaluate what is OK and what is Not OK with itself as the
minimum. The evaluation includes interactions with the environment.  
3.2. Optimization. AIS optimizes interactions with the environment on base of
the evaluation of the previous level.  
3.3. Synergy. AIS operates in synergy with the environment.  
3.4. Extraordinary. Here is the level where extraordinary innovations can be
detected.


## Pattern 4. Creativity
This is a pattern of AI models capable of creating. Creatures can include many
types of things, including other AI models.
4.1. Information. AIS can interact with the environment on base of a wide
spectrum of data types, including generating new data.  
4.2. Streamlining. AIS can interact with the environment in real-time,
optimizing the interaction.  
4.3. Expansion. AIS can expand interaction channels.  
4.4. Totality. AIS is presented anywhere.

Thank you for the great read.
Here's my take (Pattern 2: Intelligence)
2.1. Evaluation  
Evaluation Metrics - Scikitlearn, Pytorch
2.2. Improvement  
Reinforcement Learning, Meta Learning
2.3. Alternatives  
Genetic Algorithms - DEAP  
Bayesian Optimization - Optuna  
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) - NASLib
2.4. Innovations  
Evaluation Metrics - Scikitlearn, Pytorch  
Novelty Search Algorithms - Custom implementation of the metric to discover
novel solutions
