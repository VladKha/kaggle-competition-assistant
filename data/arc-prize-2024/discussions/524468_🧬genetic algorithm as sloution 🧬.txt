### ðŸ§¬genetic algorithm as sloution ðŸ§¬
Dear ARCers,  
I am trying GA with Matrix multiplication, the following is the result. It is
always close but never 100% correct, any idea how to avoid local optimum?ðŸ¥²  
my ideas is something like:
**if input (-/*/+) something = output**  
**then fine best operation and matrix for this solution with GA**

I don't believe ARC problems can be solved at all with simple matrix
operations. No matrix addition or multiplication can reproduce the
transformation you see in the example. So you need to start by coming up with
a more complicated set of operations, not a simple task I'd imagine.  
Maybe applying GA to [arc-dsl](https://github.com/michaelhodel/arc-dsl) is
another option.

very good idead , i will try and if it works i will let u know

I am also very concerned about this issue and can discuss it together

maybe add bitshift, logic etc to the mix?

sure, what is you input? also i think this cant be a general answer to this
problem but still can be interesting to work on it

Disagree, in the example above, the solution is an identity transform with a
changed color for the top/larger object, and a null transform for the
bottom/smaller object.

Interesting idea. Can you show some examples of inputs and the outputs your GA
finds?
Is the larger image a GA solution to the input on the far right, above?

I have 2 optimizer, one that randomly chose o operator , a second one wich
will generate random matrixes and choose the best one so if inpuinput is 9by9
I will multiply it by 100 random 9by9 matrixes and chose the best , change it
10% randomly 100 times  
,right it is

How do you measure fitness of a candidate solution?
Just a wild guess, but it looks like your solution set is converging too
quickly and you may be losing diversity.
Also, how would you apply your algorithm to an input for which you do not know
the output?

For each pixel which predict corect fitness+=1, true, First I fit the solution
on 3 seen data, then apply it on unseen

Do the 3 seen data examples predict perfectly?

no :), all are just close

I wondered if that were the case. The result you show is impressive for just
matrix operations, but I think you need more complex operations.
[@chenku](https://www.kaggle.com/chenku)'s suggestion is a really good one. If
you try that, please post the results.

How do you choose the matrix dimensions?

based on the previous examples
