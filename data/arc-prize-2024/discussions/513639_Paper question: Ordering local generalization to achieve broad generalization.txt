### Paper question: Ordering local generalization to achieve broad
generalization
I'm reading the core paper (amazing insights!), and I was wondering:
  * Whether the ordering of the task matters, since we're attempting at building a system that can achieve higher level of generalization. For a human, it would be unsafe to assume that a person can learn a new mathematical concept (calculate pi, for example) unless they've met some pre-requisites first (understand shapes, understand measuring distance, understand the definition of a circle, etc..)
  * Still reading through the paper, but I believe that at one point or another some developer-knowledge must be hardcoded into the solution. Axioms of some sort (such as information and constraints about the universe, in this case a grid with pixels, and key permissible actions (a single pixel can not be rotated. a pixel can not be added outside of the grid. a pixel can only have 1 of x colors)  
what are your thoughts?

> Whether the ordering of the task matters
The spirit of the tasks is that ordering should not matter. They should be
able to stand on their own and be solved without needing information from
other tasks
> developer-knowledge must be hardcoded into the solution
Yes! Some developer knowledge and influence will be in every submission. The
key part is the [developer aware
generalization](https://nagilla748.medium.com/the-spectrum-of-generalisation-
robustness-flexibility-
generality-407a24670bd8#:~:text=Developer%2Daware%20generalisation%3A%20This%20is,the%20system%20have%20encountered%20before.)
A proper test would have problems that the developer is not aware of before
hand. If the developer doesn't know the problems, then they wouldn't be able
to overfit their model to them. Requiring that the model handles new
situations.
