### Why is there a separation for the "solutions" file for training?
Why is there a separation into challenges and solutions for the train set? Am
i missing something, or shouldn't the solutions simply be an "output" field in
the challenges json?
Or is there some thought behind this?

This way, the challenges from the training and evaluation datasets have the
same format as the test file.
