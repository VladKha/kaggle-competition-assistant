### submission file name and format problem.
I just forked a public notebook to learn.
However, there are cyclic submission error messages.
when submission.json is selected, error is that zip file needed.
when store.tar.gz selected, error is that submission.json needed.

Hello, I am a new contestant who has joined this competition. I have found the
submission location you mentioned. I was wondering how to modify the official
sample_submission and submit it? My current code is as follows:  
`  
import zipfile  
with open("/kaggle/input/arc-
prize-2024/sample_submission.json",encoding='utf-8') as f:  
test_solution=json.load(f)
# 创建 ZIP 文件并添加 JSON 文件内容
with zipfile.ZipFile("submission.zip", 'w') as zipf:  
zipf.writestr('submission.json', json.dumps(test_solution))  
`
