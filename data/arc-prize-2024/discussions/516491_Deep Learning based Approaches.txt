### Deep Learning based Approaches
I am exploring on how we can solve this problem using some modified/novel deep
learning architecture or some novel training paradigm.  
Has anyone tried/found any solution using meta learning based approaches?  
Do you think DL can handle these type of few shot pattern recognition and
generation?  
Any list of ideas on approaching this problem via a novel NN architecture?
