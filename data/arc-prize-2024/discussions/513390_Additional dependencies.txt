### Additional dependencies
I started playing around with the data locally with several 3rd party
dependencies that I typically use. These are not included in the notebook
environment and I see that the submission must run without internet
connection. Is the idea that the notebooks are intended to not use any
additional packages beyond the ones provided? Or is there a way I could
include built wheels to avoid downloading and installing in the notebook? The
packages I am using are not critical to making predictions (yet) but it seems
like I might run into that.

You can use other libraries, but there are a couple of extra steps since you
can't just pip install them.
First (sounds like you already have these), get or create the wheel file (.whl
file) of the package.
Then, upload those as a kaggle dataset (there's an upload/create new dataset
button in the notebook editor on the right) and upload your whl file. You can
keep your dataset as private, or mark it as public if you want to let others
use it as well.
Then that dataset will be attached to your notebook as a local file (there's a
"copy path" button to get the full local path), and you can pip install the
library from that whl file you just uploaded
