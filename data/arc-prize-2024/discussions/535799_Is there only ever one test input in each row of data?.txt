### Is there only ever one test input in each row of data?
I just want to confirm that - in all cases - the challenge is to provide the
output for a single test input (yes, also given multiple sample input-output
pairs)? Thanks

Not in the public data.

The main idea is to do what you said. After analyzing the ['train'] inputs and
their respective outputs, you will provide the output for the ['test'] input.
A HANDFUL of tasks have more than one ['test'] input for which you need to
provide an output. MOST of them have 2 ['test'] inputs, and I think one or two
have 3 ['test'] inputs. There is no written limit. You need to provide as many
['test'] outputs as there are inputs. If your code creates the correct
['test'] output for one of the (for instance) two ['test'] inputs, you get 1/2
of a point. For a score of 26.5 (for instance)
one tiny item: the ['test'] input(s) (and the respective output(s)) are in an
array. So the majority of responses will be a array with a single item -- that
item is a 2-dimensional array (a matrix). So, if, in the weird case your
['test'] output is a 1x1 array with the value 9, that output would look like
this [[[9]]] That's an array containing a single matrix with a single row and
a single column, holding the value 9.

Many thanks, yes I think that clears things up that there may be multiple test
inputs and multiple test outputs need to be provided in response.
I suppose there is the added factor that there are two attempts allowed per
output, so one should then format those two attempts.
Perhaps it could be useful to clarify this someone (by providing a wider
variety of examples) in the submission json sample?

This is not the actual test set but a sample for syntax check. The actual test
data is hidden and will be available secretly when you submit the model for
evaluation [@ronankmcgovern](https://www.kaggle.com/ronankmcgovern)

Makes sense Ravi, thanks.
