### Can’t generate same score in rerun
I’ve noticed recently that my score ( of re-runs) is scoring lower (much
lower)  
For example my 26.5 score notebook is now scoring 20 ( rerun).
Anyone with same problem? I don’t see a reason for random or unstable output
in my code.

The only thing that changed were the task IDs (which contain no information
wrt the task whatsoever). Make sure that your script does not depend on task
IDs.

Hmm I don’t think that the IDs will cause a problem.
The validation subs are the same for the original and the re-run.
I will debug and see.
Thanks 🙏
