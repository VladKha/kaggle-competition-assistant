### 5 month comp duration?
Is this the new norm for competitions? I am noticing the last several
competitions posted don’t end for 4-5 months rather than the original 2-3
months. Was this just chance or is this a shift in Kaggle competition?

Hey Cody! This is a timeline that was set by ARC Prize 2024 (not Kaggle).
We are expecting that we'll need as much time as we can get to beat ARC-AGI.
Competitions will roughly run on an calendar year annual basis.
Happy to answer more questions

Hi! You mean you'll run the same competition again next year? Same testset,
prizes, and rules? Wondering whether there's any more information about your
plans anywhere. (E.g. the AIMO progress prize is planned to run for at most 3
years.)

Hey! ARC Prize (the grand prize) will be there till someone beats ARC-AGI. ARC
Prize 2024 (this competition) will only last through 2024 and we'll take 2025
to revamp the prize/rules/documentation with all of our learnings.

Sounds about right, I would have given the other $1M comp another 3 months
too.

…and also remove the February restriction. It's kind of strange

The highest public score has been the same for over a month, and I doubt it
will increase by a significant amount no matter how many more months we have
because of the various limitations that exist in the comp's current setup that
can reduce the max possible score one can get

The competition has been open for 3 days! We are hoping that the energy from
the community will encourage participation and increase scores.
If you have a promising solution with compute limitations please reach out and
let us know how we can help!

Hi [@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt) sorry for the
misunderstanding, I was referring to the other $1M comp
