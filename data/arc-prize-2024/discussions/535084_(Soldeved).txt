It's a stupid question maybe^^, but if it's 92% I don't think my focus will be
on this competition~
It's 46%, we have long way to go~

Where did you get the 92% figure?  
I mean, you can click and see the leaderboard, right?  
There's the public leaderboard, which by being a little more lax, is also,
unverified until it's tried on the private (hidden) test dataset… But that's
not 92%, either.  
Ahh… The **Public Leader board is 42% (Forty Two)**. Based on your follow-ups,
you might have just seen that incorrectly.

it's 46% in the public leader board, 46*2 is 92 bro~

Oh… OK. Thanks. It wasn't at all obvious that you had calculated the 92 from
the 46. Most of us are struggling to get past 26, which was basically handed
to us from 2023. An actual score of 92 would be damn near impossible. And yet
there was some recent chatter about a potential score in the high 80's. So I
assumed you had seen something. That's why I asked. I didn't realize that you
had simply multiplied the high score by two. Even though it was right there in
front of me. The simple math part, anyway. I did ask myself, "would he have
simply doubled.." but rejected that notion. So, I guess my bad for asking _my_
stupid question… Best of luck.

Where is the actual code from 2023? I cannot find it. Thank you

This is an early version:  
<https://www.kaggle.com/code/mehrankazeminia/3-arc24-developed-2020-winning-
solutions>  
gives you 26 pts in 4.5 hours… Plant a tree.

In short, 46%.
However, we should keep in mind that one task can consist of 2 test inputs.
So, if your submission produced a correct output for only one test input of
this task (and an incorrect output for the other input), you get 0.50 for this
task (out of 1.00).

Thx~It's helpful~

By the way, I'm a single eye people(I can use only my left eye or right eye or
both, when I use my left eye I'm like gpt4, when I use my right eye I tend to
be a logical person.) Hope this would be useful to guys in this competition~

Not as strong as gpt4, but when I use my left eye I'm better at remembering
things. But when I use my right eye I'm better at finding regular pattern in
things.

So I think the neural network biologically behind two eyes are at least
slightly different.

That's pretty incredible. I have a similar condition. All my life I have
bounced between genius and mental retardation (1970's term). Only this year
did I realize how the genius comes and goes. With me, when I wake up,
depending on which side I am sleeping on, I either "am" this searing genius,
pushing toward unimaginable goals, or I'm an idiot who can't get a movie scene
out of my head. I have very little control over it (I'd trade for your "close
one eye" method in a heartbeat). But it has occurred to me that there is
possibly a physical link to my corpus callosum, which bridges the brain's
hemispheres. Sometimes (early morning) it's wide open and is my best friend.
Other times, I just feel abandoned to… whatever. I can't thank you enough for
sharing.

If a movie scene can't get out of head, watch more beautiful movies James^^.

I think if we mimic the design of neural networks behind the right eye, then
there will be the time of agi.

For me there seems connection between left brain and right brain too. And I
think it's the same for all people.

As for my situation, as long as I control the intimate relationship with
girls, it's fine. But it's hard to do.
