Additionally, looks like there were two submission forms out there for papers!
I'll ensure they both point to the same form now. If you already made a
submission on either form, no need to re-submit.

Whoops! This is my fault. I had created the submission form off of a template
using a previous form and failed to update the confirmation response. It
should be updated now!

Rock and roll! But while I have you here… The term "submission" is used
ambiguously, throughout. Even on the Overview page for the contest, at the
bottom, when describing the paper submission judgement criteria, under
"Accuracy" (for starters)  
`How accurate is the submission based on its performance on the leaderboard?
(Note: you will be asked to provide your submission ID to match your notebook
to your submission)`  
I understand that there is a "paper submission" and a "notebook submission"…
If you don't share my sense of confusion about the generic use of the term
"submission" please let me know and I will explain myself better. Meanwhile,
even the form to submit (I am assuming, the "paper submission") asks for the
link to the submission, etc…

Sure thing! It could certainly feel confusing - in this particular instance
the host is intentionally looking to draw a connection between your paper and
how well your notebook submission performs (e.g. a paper shouldn't simply
discuss theory but have a poor performing model). So while you can just submit
a notebook to appear on the leaderboard (without a paper), If you submit a
paper you'll need to include the submission you're referring to.

What you mean is if, like Youssef Sanhaji's recent discussion, if you preach
100% in your paper submission, your notebook submission needs do do very, very
well (not… like… 26%) Your paper needs to reflect what your notebook actually
achieves.
