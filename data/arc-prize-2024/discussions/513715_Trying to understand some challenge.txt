### Trying to understand some challenge
I'm trying to understand some of the challenges but I can't, for example for
the id '662c240a'. Does anyone understand the logic ?
Maybe the AI is better than me

I found 2 solutions:
  1. Symmetry: In every triplet, 2 are symmetrical and the assymetrical is the answer.
  2. Colour priority: Brown always dominates over other colours.
I found the colour priority one the first, most obvious, but I think the
symmetry one is the intention. Note that both of these yield the correct
solution.

I agree this one is difficult, took me few minutes but I think I understood:
  1. We see from the examples that 3x9 input grid -> output a 3x3 grid ([:,0:3], [:,3:6] or [:,6:9])
  2. To know which of the three it is, I think you have to look at the colors : 
     * Ex1 : Yellow&Green > Red,Blue,LightBlue, (…other colors in input example1)
     * Ex2: Green&Purple > …other colors in input example2)
     * …
     * Ex4: Yellow&Blue > Green, … other colors in input4 
  3. Conclusion: What is the color from test input with highest priority ? Yellow ( from ex1& ex2 ) So we output the 3x3 grid with Yellow 
Hope this makes sense, it wasn't easy for me to write

Also my initial idea and it gives the correct solution, but I think they
intended for a symmetry-based solution. Note that in every triplet, there are
2 symmetrical and 1 assymetrical grids. The assymetrical one is always the
solution.
I do agree this one is relatively difficult. It took me longer than any of the
others I've tried so far, although I should add I've only done a subset of
about 20-30 so far.

I think you right! I didn't see the symmetrical diagonal, now that you said
it, I think it's a better solution

This is great! It's a total mystery! Now you know what the average "AI" is up
against. And so we study and study and study (alone, or in groups) and
eventually we figure it out, and it becomes WAY easier to code! What's missing
(to honest AI researchers) is… Shouldn't the AI have figured it out on its
own? To which I respond, Shouldn't the humans have done so? And so we see more
of the true nature of intelligence. It is a social experience, whether you're
out there teaching your son how to catch fly balls, or discussing among a
bunch of post-docs what colored object is "correct". (hint: you get three
tries!) Never felt so much like a monkey at the base of the monolith!  
PS: Absolutely correct, [@hashpanda](https://www.kaggle.com/hashpanda) ! Roger
the symmetry! (you said it, but it sailed right past me!)
