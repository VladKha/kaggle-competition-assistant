It looks ok to me, can you explain the error you see?

Train[0] Input differs from the other 3 inputs in that the "square image" gets
flipped LR (normal, flip, normal) and the other 3 inputs (Train[1], Train[2],
Train[3]) do not appear to flip the image in the input. Maybe I'm seeing it
incorrectly. This does not affect the outputs if the rule is simply to copy
the first square image from the Input matrix.

Oh, It's correct. I'm confused when I saw the Train[0] differs from other
inputs (Train[1], Train[2], Train[3]). but the input set do not have to follow
a patten.

I think what they are trying to say is that if you take the inputs and slice
them into thirds, for train 1-3 the output matches any of those 'slices'. For
train 0, it matches the first and the last slice, but not the middle.

The input for 2dee498d Train[0] seems incorrect, but there are no hard and
fast rules. As long as you observe the input and isolate the first "square
design", it works. It is off-putting to be sure, but that is the difference
between a human "player" and a machine "process." That said, Train[0] Input is
notably different, and it is quite disturbing. I'm not sure if that qualifies
as an error. Had you not reported it, I probably would have had a difficult
time with it as well. But it's not about what we think it should be, so much
as, what it takes to get the correct "answer," which (with your help) I was
able to submit correctly, with a sense of certainty!
