### FYI: Fixes issued for certain training/evaluation tasks
We have recently updated the "training" data and "evaluation" files used in
the competition with minor fixes for evaluations tasks `20818e16`, `9def23fe`,
`05a7bcf2`, `310f3251`, `4852f2fa`, `79fb03f4`, `c35c1b4c`, `e6de6e8f`, as
well as training tasks `b230c067` and `9edfc990`. In nearly all cases, the
fixes target an inconsistency in a training pair that would not have prevented
the task from being solvable by a human. Thanks to all who reported issues!
As a reminder, the private test has been previously verified to be 100%
solvable by humans.
Best of luck with the competition!

What about ac0c5833 example 3?

Issued a fix on GitHub, not live on Kaggle yet. This issue is not blocking to
solve the task, mind you.

Quick followup question: how long did the human take to score 100%? (how many
minutes, hours - just curious)

From one of the two people who solved the private test tasks (independently
each): _"I needed for most tasks less than 30 seconds to figure the rule out.
For few tasks up to a few minutes or a second look at a later point of time
[…] there were two or three tasks I couldn't solve"_
Taken together, they solved 100% of the tasks, but for any given person, a
rate of 97-98% would be normal. Some tasks are non-obvious, but they're never
very difficult.

Thank you. I realized only too late that "100% solvable by humans" was not
what I thought.
