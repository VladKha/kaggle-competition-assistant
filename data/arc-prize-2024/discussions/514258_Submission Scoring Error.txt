### Submission Scoring Error
Hi, it's my first time participate in ARC Prize competition and I met a
problem I don't know how to solve.
I submitted my predictions a few times, but the result was always "Submission
Scoring Error". The log shew my notebook successfully ran and generated
"submission.json"( and I I checked it). But unfortunately, the scoring system
always took a long time and throw "Submission Scoring Error" :(
Can anybody tell me how to solve this?

I made a very simple notebook at the begging of the challenge that is able to
score 0: <https://www.kaggle.com/code/ironbar/minimal-submission>
Check that you are using the right format, also I remember reading some people
that had problems when saving more than one json file. If you are saving
multiple files try removing all except from the submission file.
