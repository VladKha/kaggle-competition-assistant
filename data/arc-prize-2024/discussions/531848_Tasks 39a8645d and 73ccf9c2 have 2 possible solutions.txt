  * choose the most common shape (accepted answer)
  * choose the shape in the top left corner
73ccf9c2:

**This seems to not be so much "choosing a shape" as it is "creating a pattern
from a shape"**

>  choose the bottom most shape
**Ex. 2 _has no_ bottom most shape**

39a8645d really has 2 possible outputs based on train examples (I was wrong is
my previous reply). If one sees choosing the shape in the upper left corner, a
valid guess based on the train examples, he will get it wrong as the author's
answer is based on most common occurrence instead. The examples needs to
demonstrate only 1 possible solution.

Thanks… fuzzthink. You're humble and lovable.  
Turbo (and you) were right. I have no idea why when I typed 39a8645d into the
ARC game URL I saw a different task. My response was that of an idiot.
Apologies all 'round.

39a8645d: Not a concern as both interpretations yield the same result.
73ccf9c2: Not true. Choose the bottom most shape does not apply to the 2nd eg.

In the 2nd train example of 73ccf9c2 the shape on the right starts 1 row lower
than the left one, so there is a bottom most shape.

39a8645d: no, they don't. The accepted solution is the red shape, the top left
shape is the green one.

How do yo define bottom most? in 73ccf9c2 there are two shapes at the bottom
in the second train sample.
