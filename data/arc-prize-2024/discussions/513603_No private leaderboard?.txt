### No private leaderboard?
Hi all!
I am a little confused by how there is no private leaderboard. Here,
<https://arcprize.org/guide>, it says:
> To ensure fair evaluation results, be sure not to leak information from the
> evaluation set into your algorithm (e.g. by looking at the tasks in the
> evaluation set yourself during development, or **by repeatedly modifying an
> algorithm while using its evaluation score as feedback.**)
But if this leaderboard is calculated with all of the test data, are we not
violating the above-quoted recommendation by modifying an algorithm using the
score from the leaderboard?
