### Playing ARC games 🎮🕹️
Hello everyone. 🤗  
I wanna share some overthinking about the ARCprize.  
In case u think I’m wrong please let me know, cause sometimes I think that I’m
losing time.
Well, I personally think that we need to manually solve several ARC games to
understand the steps of reasoning process needed to decide a way to solve each
example and then develop an algorithm of classification, then work on each
clasificación.

That seems like the best way to proceed! :-)  
That said, you will find that there are very many classifications!!!  
You may experience what I experienced… The process of solving them does not
rely on classifying them (certainly not at first) And it isn't until you do
quite a few that you have your first, "oh yeah, this was like that one,"
reaction (the start of classifying).
