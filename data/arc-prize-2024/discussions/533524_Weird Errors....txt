### Weird Errors...
I write here to see if anyone else has experienced this.  
Has anyone submitted a notebook change and had it fail, only to find that
there was a tiny syntax error?  
Just a small thing, like a typographical error… Maybe happening multiple
times?  
I'm lucky in that it only happened to me twice, to date. The first time, a
stray "delete" moved two lines onto one line, and that occurred near the top
of the notebook. I assumed that was my error. The second time, a pair of ones
(1) found their way into the code, only this was near the bottom, so it ran
for 3 hours before failing. I really would have thought it was just my own
carelessness, if not for the weirdness of having the digit 1 appear in two
different places. How could I have accidentally done something that precise
(without, say, deleting all the text between them or similar)?  
It absolutely certainly could be my laptop, whose aging track pad definitely
does some weird stuff. But the precision of the two 1's sort of rules that
out, as well. It would be like a person with Tourette's accidentally backing
into the wrong parking space. It's the wrong "class" of error.

Move as much code as possible to a repository, so the Kaggle Notebook is
reduced to as few lines as possible, less than 100 lines.
automated testing.
Make it deterministic. When looping over a dictionary, sort the keys
beforehand. So results can be reproduced.
I do that in my ARC Prize 2024 project.

In the Ariel data challenge last week I had a notebook that "lost' last 3
lines of code in one of the cells when I tried to edit. Was repeatable over a
couple of days. No idea why but it's the only weirdness on kaggle in many
years.
