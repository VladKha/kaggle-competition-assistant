It _is_ the same one, only the one you found ended four years ago. It was the
original version (notice Francois' name at the bottom of the page) of the
current one. And the prize is 50x bigger, this time.

Consider this competition a continuation of the competition you listed. AGI is
still nowhere near the level of humans, and continuing the competition allows
people to keep applying the latest techniques to push the cutting edge even
further!
