Since tasks for ARC Prize 2024 are identical to 2020 ARC challenge, you can
start with studying best solutions to 2020 challenge. Even though they don't
perform well enough to be competitive in 2024, you can reuse same ideas ,
refine and improve them. Possibly even combine several solutions together.

This competition welcomes people to give it a go, from all different levels of
skill. No-one has been able to do that well on the arc set for a few years now
… so it might require some out-of-the-box thinking.
You may want to start on this starter notebook and have a play:
