### What kind of "objects" there are in the figures?
I would like to hear what are your impressions on what "objects" are present
on the images.  
By object I mean a pattern that a human would likely recognize as representing
an entity "per se".  
So far, I think we have those categories:
  * Blocks
    * Rectangles (of which squares are a subset)
    * Blobs
  * Lines
    * Straight (vertical or horizontal)
    * Diagonal
    * Mixed
  * "Fills"
    * Single color (like background)
    * Patterned (repetition of elements, symmetries)
  * Dots (single pixels which do not belong to blocks or lines)
I think that it is a very important element of the challenge the fact that
humans can make multiple descriptions in terms of entities of what they see in
a picture of ARC. For example, a checkerboard pattern can be both seen as a
fill (with a pattern) or a set of lines. Which description is the most useful
to solve the task depends on the applicability to the other examples on the
same set and its "complexity".
Do you think there are other objects that do not fit in the above categories?
I would like to see images of counter-examples and hear what you think about
this categorization of patterns present in ARC.

As a follow up on this, what are some concrete ways to detect objects?  
Maybe a specific defiiniton will help since as noted in the other comment,
this abstraction can from simple blocks and traingles to 'liquid'.

Great Q!! Not at all easy to detect objects. There is a very good possibility
that there are ML techniques. Not my specialty. And when I said "water" that
was an extremely high-level interpretation. Interesting "challenge", to be
sure! The large problem is, though we can talk about and agree (or disagree!)
upon what an object "is" or "could be", the real issue is achieving a working
definition with a machine (or program) that isn't just "code it up!". I mean
you _could_ just code it up… but it would probably not contribute to your
score.  
I'll just say this here.  
The way humans do it involves moving the eyeballs. The peripheral vision is
capable of detecting motion at a low level, pulling the eyeball in the
direction of the motion, where the fovea centralis can detect sharp edges (and
basically do the OCR). This is an evolutionary function that helped keep our
ancestors alive! When the eye moves just a little, objects in the periphery
create a "faux motion" that quickly pulls the fovea toward the object,
allowing us to register its existence and classify what we see. We map a
persistent "object location" so we are not continually surprised by objects in
our peripheral vision. But when the glance brings a "new" object into view, it
takes a precedent and we "deal with it."  
Not so sure the best way to detect 'objects' as defined by integers in a
matrix. Perhaps some hybrid technology. Currently, I am scanning 5 rows at a
time, but it's early days in deciding what, exactly to do with that
information.  
YMMV!

I think that a good amount of the object can be detected solely based on set
of well written, carefully tested "cell adjacency" logics. This is very easy
to do with unicolor objects, more tricky with multicolored ones. I am actually
working in that direction.

Excellent question. I see 2 answers. First off, what you described should be
enough to score quite high on the test. That said, the hard part is getting a
program to work with even those few. The other answer is, there are miles to
go. For instance, my snap answer is, a perfect circle. Seeing something like
that will definitely elicit an intellectual and emotional response (I use the
term "sound") in 21st century humans. And with a 30x30 matrix, you can
approximate one quite well. So there are reasons that you have not seen a
perfect circle in the current mix. (One could go on, here…) One won't. Also,
equilateral triangles exude their own "sound" (also attainable at 30x30). The
point is, the larger the matrix; the greater the possibilities. Once you get
in the "rods/cones" resolution, say 224x224, then you can (with only 10
values) begin to differentiate between pizza and steak images. (both are valid
"objects") My mom would have said, "finish what you have on your plate."  
Also "sprites" (those little 3x3 images we have grown to love) might go on
your list, as well as the notion of a "part" or "pixel" which play a role in
the 3x3 -> 9x9 expansions. One has to process that the sprite is made up of
parts, each of which gets somehow enlarged or reduced in the output.  
I've also noticed at least one "meta-object". In short, a gray line that
separates two or more areas, and has no other purpose than to differentiate
"this" from "that".  
Also, walls. Especially walls that either, while intact, contain a color, or
when broken allow the color to escape. (again, this was conveyed at a very
large matrix size). So walls and meta-walls. And liquid.  
"And this paddle game. And this chair…"
