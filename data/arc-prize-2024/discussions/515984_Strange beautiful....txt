### Strange beautiful...
3 hours ago, I watched part of a FC interview on YouTube. They discussed the
notion of "coming up with new puzzles," so I took a minute to think one
through. Just now, as I was walking a few of the challenges, I stumbled across
2dd70a9a. Which was essentially what I had imagined, earlier. Just one of
those things.

The referenced [task
2dd70a9a](https://neoneye.github.io/arc/edit.html?dataset=ARC&task=2dd70a9a)
is a snake game. The orientation of snakehead and snaketail, determines how
the snake bends. Indeed a beautiful puzzle.

And perhaps a little more "time traveling" than average.
