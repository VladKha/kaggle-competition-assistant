### Prediction 0%
I am getting ~48% on training set, ~22% on evaluation set, but whenever I
submit I get 0%. In the output file, I leave the "input" section within the
JSON file, could that possibly mess things up? Example of output:

Also, the process is looking for a strictly-formatted answer - just the two
attempts, etc. That will definitely mess things up, as far as even getting a
score. BUT, the private test suite is specifically engineered to be new. There
are no examples from the old training or eval. You really _are supposed to be
getting a score of zero_ if you are in any way relying on previous examples.

I guess I will remove the input section to make sure the output is certainly
evaluated correctly. As for the private test set, there are training examples
given for which I fine-tune into my model. Thanks for your helpful input!

I think this is because the test data are significantly more challenging than
both the training and validation data.

Yes, including the "input" section in the output JSON file could potentially
mess up the submission format. Typically, submission files are expected to
follow a specific format, and any extra or incorrect information can lead to
errors or a score of 0%. I recommend removing the "input" section and any
other unnecessary information from the output file before submitting it to
ensure it matches the required format.
