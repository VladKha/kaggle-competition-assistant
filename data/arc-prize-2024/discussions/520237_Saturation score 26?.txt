### Saturation score 26?
Why are they soooo many competitors in leaderboard with score 26, but then
suddenly socre goes down to 18? Where are the 25s, 24s…? And the 27s?
It is a strange distribution, even if everyone is using a similar trick.
Do all of them solve correctly the same 26 problems and fail on the remaining
74?
Thanks

This is the second run of the competition. Last time the competitions top 10
(or so) solutions were made available publicly.  
See more here: <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-
prize-2024/discussion/511728>.
All the 18% you are see are all running Icecuber's winning code. (there might
be some exceptions to this, but it is pretty likely they are running
Icecuber's code).
Likewise, the 26% is an ensemble of a small subset of the top 10 solutions,
including Icecuber's code. It also seems to be carefully curated as I've tried
to improve it by adding others to ensemble, but to no avail.
The two above are publicly available notebooks - so there is no effort to
submit these. For me it was instant regret, as I know that I have a mountain
to climb if I can ever improve upon on it. My own 5% solution is completely
subsumed by the 26%.

Thanks for the detailed breakdown, rxe. There's a lot of folks with single-
digit scores. They deserve some kind of "honorable mention" nod! They (you)
toughed it out - not at all a trivial task. Hmmm… Consider yourselves
"honorably mentioned." That includes zero (a single digit) with a handful of
submissions. Keep trying!
On a slightly different note, does anyone know if the correct test private
input and output for ARC 2020 can be found? I know Francois tries to be
consistent and random about these things (so it shouldn't matter), but I am
still curious what the questions and "correct" answers were, back then.

26% is the baseline score, using the solution to ARC 2020
