### Main guideline for achieving 100% results.
I just participated in this competition, and so far, I've come to the
following conclusion:  
Does a human being need to see and understand the training or evaluation
examples to solve, for instance, the puzzle with ID "007bbfb7"?  
The answer is obviously no. A human can solve any puzzle simply by visualizing
3 to 5 examples.
Conclusion: the solution to create a model capable of predicting the output
puzzle is independent of whether or not the training dataset is visualized.
Therefore:
  * The model to be predicted should not rely on the training dataset.
  * The model must be able to predict the dimensions of the output puzzle.
  * The model must be able to predict the shape of the output.
These three points are key to definitively solving the problem.
Soon, I will share with you an "out of the box" approach, and I'd love to hear
your feedback.

While it is true that most of us solved 007bbfb7 without the benefit of either
the training or the evaluation, we did have our entire lives as human beings
to sort of make up for that lack. Some of us really got into that puzzle kind
of thing back when we were in high school (xxx years ago) and had that many
years for our xxtrillion brain cells to bang those ideas around. If you are
training a model from zero, the best you could hope for would be 100% of eval
and training and 100% of 2020's eval and training, etecetcetc… Maybe if you
had an LLM that trained on only puzzle-solving sites, then yeah, ok skip the
eval and training, but NOT REALLY. Even with every puzzle site under your belt
(as an LLM) You would still do better - MUCH BETTER - banging on the 2024 800
sets. Definitely looking forward to your upcoming out-of-the-box approach!  
Also, the three points that you listed are indeed important, but add another
18,000 points to that and you're getting warm.

Good point. It might be possible to develop an approach which performs well
without training on the provided data. However, the provided data can still be
used in this case to validate your approach, hence its usefulness.
