I am a Bachelors in Engineering student Majoring in Artificial Intelligence
and Data Science. I have active interest around liquid Intelligence system and
leveraging such Intelligence to teach it to adapt to scenarios it hasn't seen
before, like for example
How can you teach a machine learning algorithm to learn to adapt to avoiding
potholes while driving even if it's training hasn't seen the label for such.
To Takle this problem, a liquid Intelligence algorithm is probable.
Looking to join a team and I am open to collaboration.

That's an interesting read! But I think avoiding potholes shouldn't be the
focus. There shouldn't be potholes in the first place, in a world with FSD.
It's an interesting problem and liquid intelligence system is a new term for
me, thanks!
