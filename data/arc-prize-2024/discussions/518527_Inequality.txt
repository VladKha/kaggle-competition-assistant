### Inequality
I just played 834ec97d. I submitted, and got it wrong. Tiny detail, Fixed.
Submit. Confetti.  
If I were an AGI, I would have to submit 2 answers, click the submit button,
and get no feedback at all. Someone else (what's a "programmer"?) would get
the feedback as a "total correct" single value. In the mail. 650 years later.  
Just for laughs, I made an erroneous color addition, submitted 20 times,
eliminated the error, submit, confetti. This is not so subtle. If you made the
human play like the AGI ("you'll get a total score after 100 submissions")
interest would plummet. Also, aside from the obvious (noted) potential to game
the system, the immediate feedback is vital to what is being built in a human
system. There is a real process: view, construct rules, create based on rules,
feedback. And without the final step, it's really not a very good game for
humans. For a reason.  
I know that managing this complaint will do little to forward the progress of
ML, but it could really turbo charge the progress of AGI (the concern, I
believe, that was its original inspiration).
