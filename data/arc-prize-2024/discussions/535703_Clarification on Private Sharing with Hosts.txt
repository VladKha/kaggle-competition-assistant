### Clarification on Private Sharing with Hosts
Hey all,
We've had questions come up from participants on whether or not sharing your
notebooks/code with the competition organizers mid-competition is legitimate
and within the rules. [Greg](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt) has been
asking many of you individually about your approach thus far to better
understand the techniques producing the top solutions. Sharing is optional but
if it's with the host team (please confirm it's them first) it's allowed and
does not violate the competition's private sharing rules.
Hope that helps clarify!

Still, you can voluntarily 'publish' whatever you like, correct? Regardless of
how many/few points you attain? So I could make public my entire process,
code, notes, and having done so voluntarily, and in public (Discussion, Code),
it would not be considered 'private sharing', right?

Yep exactly, you can share publicly no problem

Correct! The only limitation we typically require on public sharing is that
notebooks not be shared publicly close to the competition deadline, in order
to reduce any 'copy-and-paste-for-gold' opportunities. We re-open publication
after the deadline as well. We highly encourage and support knowledge sharing
at all other times!
