### Freelance help
A question to organizers, is it allowed to employ outside workforce to do some
mechanical tasks, like labelling and new examples generation? Without
including them in the team.

See that rules section for the answer. You may use proprietary datasets.
However in order to be eligible for a prize you will need to open source it at
the end of the competition

Comps sometimes don't allow private datasets, but I didn't see that in this
one. Perhaps someone else saw something though.

I am not an organizer but I think it is not allowed. By the way, how much
money are you planning to pay to those people? Maybe I would be interested in
it 😄

That's funny how in the first sentence you say it is not allowed and in the
second offer you help 😅.

 _Disclaimer: I'm not an organizer._
Since external datasets are allowed, you should be able to do this.
Usually, paid data annotators go in acknowledgments on a research paper and
not co-authors. So technically they don't have to be on your team. Good luck!
😊
