### Check out my work in 2020 ARC Competition
I just checked out my work in [2020
competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/abstraction-and-reasoning-
challenge) and found it really impressive.
Younger and smarter version of me clearly surpassed my current abilities and
imagination.  
Please, check it out and let see maybe you will be able to build something on
top.
  * [Watch, draw, compare, evolve!](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elvenmonk/watch-draw-compare-evolve)  
Ideas described there go well beyond my current ambitions and abilities.
  * [Visualizing tasks, size/color EDA, solutions](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elvenmonk/visualizing-tasks-size-color-eda-solutions)  
At least few steps ahead of my current effort:  
[ðŸ§®ARC24ðŸ§ Visualization + Size
Predictor](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elvenmonk/arc24-visualization-size-
predictor)  
[ðŸ§®ARC24ðŸ§  Size, Background Stats + Grid line
marks](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elvenmonk/arc24-size-background-stats-grid-
line-marks)

### What stands out:
  * Comprehensive size pattern and constraints analysis. Very accurate and insightful.
  * Clever use of `scipy.ndimage.measurements` for 2D object labelling. Visualization of labelled data (starting from task 14, default solver).
    
    
    from scipy.ndimage.filters import generic_filter
    from scipy.ndimage.measurements import find_objects, label
    
    def default_solver(x):
        return label(x, structure=w3)[0]%10

Just one example of plotted labelling (3rd row):

The `Watch, draw, compare, evolve!` link is 404. Kaggle shows a `We can't find
that page.`.

Thanks for pointing that out. Looks like it was not shared publicly
