###  Thoughts on Using LLM Models (ChatGPT, Gemini etc.) for Assistance in
Competitions?
I’ve been thinking about the role of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT
in competitions like this, and I’m curious to hear your thoughts. We all know
the rules discourage sharing ideas or solutions outside of Kaggle, but what
about using LLMs to help understand concepts or get general guidance?
Here are a few specific points I’d like to hear from the community about:
Do you think it's fair to use LLMs for general conceptual advice (e.g., asking
for help understanding certain algorithms or exoplanet transit data)?
Where would we draw the line between using LLMs for learning and using them to
generate potential solutions for the competition?
Has anyone used LLMs for any similar tasks, and what are your thoughts on
whether this is within the spirit of the competition?
I feel like it could be a gray area, so I wanted to hear from others. I want
to make sure that I’m playing fair, but at the same time, I'm curious whether
there’s a consensus on how far is too far when using tools like this.

The confusion arises from how one can see LLM as either an external data
source or a platform for indirect or implicit sharing of ideas and code. If it
is an external data, and freely or comercially accessible like gemini pro, I
think OK as long as one cite an external dataset. But it is regarded as a
platform, we must clarify whether it is conflict with the no-sharing rule.

As far as I understand you cannot share code with other teams. That does not
include LLMs

I don't see any problem in using LLMs for any task related to the competition.
Could you elaborate more your question? What would be the problem or the
forbidden use of LLMs?
