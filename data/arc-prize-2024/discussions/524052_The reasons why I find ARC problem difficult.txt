### The reasons why I find ARC problem difficult
The reasons why I find ARC problem difficult.
When I first saw the problem in the ARC Prize 2024, it made me think of the
challenge of training a AI to find approximate solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs) using graph neural networks (GNNs).

Partial differential equations typically generate successive solutions based
on an initial state.
However, the challenge presented in the ARC Prize 2024 has a large gap.

There is a large gap between the initial state and the answer state, as shown
by a particular example on the EDA notebook
This makes solving the ARC Prize 2024 problem more challenging than solving
partial differential equations.
  * (1) Limited data availability.
  * (2) Unfixed environments.
  * (3) A variety of complex problems.
  * (4) A significant distance between the initial and answer states.
  * (5) Too many colors (different colors can be identified, but simultaneously exchanging colors doesn't alter the nature of the problem)
I'm considering approaching the problem by creating a state vector that
combines the initial state and the answer state.
I would like to try using GNN or transformer model.

thanks, you are right.
