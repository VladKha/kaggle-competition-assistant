### Platform for Creating ARC-AGI Puzzles (revisited)
Hi. I am developing a platform for creating and sharing ARC-AGI Puzzles:
<https://arcplayground.com/>
This is a follow-up post from this thread:
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024/discussion/518522>
# ARC Playground
At its core, ARC Playground is a platform for creating, sharing, and playing
ARC-AGI puzzles. However, this platform provides an opportunity to evolve the
ARC-AGI benchmark beyond the static set of puzzles provided in the evaluation,
training, and testing datasets.


## Vision
Ultimately, I believe in the scalability and extensibility of the ARC
benchmark. As our models increase in reasoning capability, our benchmarks
should increase in complexity and diversity. I think these puzzles have a high
ceiling when it comes to encoding logical rules, pattern recognition, and
abstract reasoning challenges.  
By allowing the community to create and share puzzles, we can:
  * Generate a more diverse set of challenges
  * Identify novel patterns and rules that push the boundaries of AI reasoning
  * Create a dynamic benchmark that evolves with advancements in AI technology


## What's next?
  * An interface for interacting with the community-crafted dataset of puzzles
  * A cohesive user system that allows users to access their created puzzles.
  * An auditing system for measuring puzzle quality (something in the form likes, comments, ratings, solve stats).
  * UI/UX overhaul


## Known Bugs
  * Visual bug on puzzle grid rendering.
  * When coloring by dragging, there is sometimes an unresponsiveness on the first cell that is colored in.


## Feedback
I am going to spend the next day or two attempting to create some challenging
while logically rigid puzzles. If you have some time, please try creating a
puzzle for yourself and uploading it to the community database. Let me know
your thoughts on any aspect, improvements to make, or suggestions for
features.
I am very open to public constructive feedback (in this thread) or private
feedback (you can reach me at cjchristianjones at gmail dot com).
I consider this platform in its current form to be a prototype and rough
around the edges. I have a lot to learn when it comes to building this
application, but I am excited to keep working on it.

### Important Notes
  * While there is no formal user system in place yet, try creating puzzles with a constant username that you would likely use. When I integrate a user system, I will make sure the puzzles you might make now transfer to your profile.

Thanks for making this I enjoy it and added a couple puzzles.
I think it would be nice to be able to download other's puzzles, as well as
making sure they are open sourced by default. The community could use more
examples, especially since the leaders right now are so far ahead in that
regard with their million sample dataset. I'd be more likely to continue
creating puzzles there if I knew we can use the samples for training.

Thanks for checking out the site, and making some puzzles!
I agree, there is a lot of value in being able to download other's puzzles. I
will be adding an interface for interacting with community created puzzles in
the future.

Your platform for creating and sharing ARC-AGI puzzles looks promising; I'm
excited to try creating some puzzles and will provide feedback to help improve
it! [@cjchristianjones](https://www.kaggle.com/cjchristianjones)

I tried to visit with a VPN now, and it works!
I live in Bangladesh and there's some issues with the internet connection in
my country, that's why I couldn't visit the site before. Not a problem from
your end.
Thanks.
