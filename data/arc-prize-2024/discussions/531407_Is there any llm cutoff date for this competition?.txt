### Is there any llm cutoff date for this competition?
Do we have any llm that can not be used in this competition?  
For AIMO, they setup the cut off date for the llm that we can use. do we have
the limit on this competition?

No, there is not. Use any model you want.

No, and I don't think cutoff date make any sense for a task abstract enough
like ARC as long as the private test set is not leaked.

Do you think that the AIMO LLM cutoff date relates to the amount of internet
data relating to the IMO or even the AIMO, itself? It feels like there is some
risk of ARC "answers" flooding the internet, as well. I know that there is a
principle, here, but one has to consider… If the chatter level of things like
"here are some PRIORS to WIN ARC-AGI." becomes abundant enough, LLMs will have
their "Cliffs Notes" for ARC, as well. Perhaps a cutoff date might be
appropriate. I just watched the South Park Episode "Deep Learning" (probably
from 2019, knowing those guys). I swear the kid who enters the boys' room
while they are making their secret homework-cheating plans reminds me of
Lecun. Of course that's insulting, because all of those characters are so
grotesquely drawn… But I felt a sort of "insider pride" in imagining why they
spent so long on that part of one scene. I mean, it's a minute of silence
while the kid goes to the bathroom, washes his hands, throws the paper towel
away, and then stares right into the camera for like 2 or 3 seconds before
leaving. Besides, it's middle school and this kid had a 5-o'clock shadow!
