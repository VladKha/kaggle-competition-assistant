### Question about team and requirements
HI
I can there be teams of 1? Also, are we require to use an LLM or just highly
encouraged to? Or perhaps highly discouraged to?Your input will help , thanks!
Also, do we need to incrementally show progress or just results after final
deadline?
thanks
Christian

You can compete as an individual or as a team. You are neither encouraged or
discouraged from using any models. You are just limited by gpu/cpu inference
time limit and licence restrictions.  
Submissions after deadline won't be accepted for awarding prize/medals. You
may submit and see your progress and depending on your c strategy choose the
allowed number of top performing Submissions to count towards medals/prize.
