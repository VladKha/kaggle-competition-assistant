### ChatGPT 4o
For testing i tried to use chatgpt to see if it can pick up on patterns (as
the point of this competition is that it cant and we need something else then
a LLM). I found that it already did quite well, I just copied one of the input
examples and tested if it could deduce how the transformation took place.
The example I chose is a grid where the squares surrounded by 3's get filled
in by a 4. Note that this is not the first transformation I asked it to do, I
first asked it to transform a 4x4 grid of a and b's, where the result is just
the a,b's swapped
My input:  
input: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3,
0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0,
0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
ChatGPT:  
To achieve the desired transformation, where specific elements (specifically,
replacing certain 0s with 4s) need to be modified in the matrix, you can
follow a similar approach but with additional conditions. Here's the Python
code to accomplish this transformation:  
def transform_matrix(matrix):  
# Get the dimensions of the matrix  
rows = len(matrix)  
cols = len(matrix[0])
    
    
    # Create a copy of the input matrix to avoid modifying the original
    output_matrix = [row[:] for row in matrix]
    
    # Iterate over each element in the matrix
    for i in range(1, rows - 1):
        for j in range(1, cols - 1):
            # Check if the current element is 0 and the surrounding elements form a pattern with 3s
            if (matrix[i-1][j] == 3 and matrix[i+1][j] == 3) or (matrix[i][j-1] == 3 and matrix[i][j+1] == 3):
                output_matrix[i][j] = 4
    
    return output_matrix
    
    
    content_copy
# Input matrix
input_matrix = [  
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  
[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],  
[0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0],  
[0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0],  
[0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0],  
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  
]
# Transform the matrix
output_matrix = transform_matrix(input_matrix)
# Display the output matrix
for row in output_matrix:  
print(row)
I justed wanted to share and maybe inspire someone. I do think the formatting
of your examples and question might be important. ChatGPT is trained on a
bunch of online data so putting it in a format it recognizes will probably
help (just like with humans and how we like it if it is a picture format with
colored pixels and for us a list of lists is hard to visualise as we have not
been "trained" on that)

Hi Dekker,  
could ChatGPT write snippet to deliver ARC drawings?
