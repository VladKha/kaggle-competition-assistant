### Evaluation challenges for training
[@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt) Since the evaluation
challenges and solutions are in separate files, I am unsure if we are allowed
to use evaluation challenges for training?

You can use whatever data you want for training, the train/eval partition in
this competition is just a suggestion.

As [@ironbar](https://www.kaggle.com/ironbar) said, you can use whatever you
want. According to Chollet, the eval set is meant to be a little bit harder.
