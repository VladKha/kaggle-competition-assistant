### Model checkpoints under non-commercial licences?
Hi, I was wondering if we were allowed to use pre-trained model checkpoints
licensed under CC-BY-NC or similar licenses? I understand our submission has
to be MIT, but there's a quote in the rules about a potential exception:
> If your winning solution has been generated with input data or pre-trained
> models which either host or participant determine has been produced with an
> incompatible license, you will have to provide the organizers with a
> detailed description, to the Competition Sponsor’s satisfaction, of how the
> winning submission was generated. This includes a detailed description of
> methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the
> description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture,
> preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The
> description should also include a link to a code repository with complete
> and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced.
> Whether a submission meets the eligibility criteria or not shall be
> determined by the Competition Sponsor, whose decision shall be final.
Before I commit to anything, is it possible to get a clarification on this?
For example, if checkpoints, training code and data are all available, but
only under a non-commercial licence, are those criteria met?
Could you provide examples of models that meet those criteria and models that
don't?

Hey! Thanks for asking!
Models that wouldn't work would be like gpt-4 and claude sonnet. We don't have
insight into their inner workings and wouldn't be able to reproduce the
results from scratch.
Models that do work are like llama 3, where everything is open sourced. Even
though llama has restrictions around commercial use, etc. This is the "you
will have to provide the organizers with a detailed description, to the
Competition Sponsor’s satisfaction, of how the winning submission was
generated" part
So as long as the model is 100% explainable and can be made publicly available
(at the end of the competition it would work)

Hi [@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt), a related question: Are
datasets for fine tuning which are licensed as "Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0
International" for example allowed, as long as we can provide steps to
reproduce?
