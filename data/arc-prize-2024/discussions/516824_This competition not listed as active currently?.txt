### This competition not listed as active currently?
Hi all I just noted ARC Prize 2024 isn't showing on my list of Active
Competitions
I haven't withdrawn and can still submit predictions‚Ä¶ curious if anyone else
noticed the same thing?

If you join a competition and then don't submit for a while (I'm not sure what
the time frame is), Kaggle moves the competition from "My Active" competition
list to just the "Active" list. You're still enrolled and can still submit,
and if you do then it will pop back up into your active competition list.
I think it's just a UI thing to keep the "my active" list to only list the
competitions that you're actively submitting to.

Thanks that tracks with my experience.
Happy Kaggling and I hope you learn something new and useful this week üëç
