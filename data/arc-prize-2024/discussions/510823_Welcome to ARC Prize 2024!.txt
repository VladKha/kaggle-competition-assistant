Hello i have just discovered ARC-AGI and kaggle competition last week.  
Thank you very much for this very interresting challenge.
I have a newbee question : when i submit a notebook today and get a score, is
it the result of my notebook for the "secret test-challenge tasks" or the
"dummy test-challenge tasks" ? Is there a trace of this information in the
outputs or log of the notebook ?

Do we have to test the tasks individually or all together?

I'll try to be here or in similar competitions soon. Seems fantastic!

How can we test whether an AI has the ability to understand and reason
abstractions in general, rather than just following certain patterns in
existing data?

Good question I guess it will depend on the ability of solving Depp logical
problems outside data base

Hey [@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt) ,
Thank you for the warm welcome and the comprehensive guide! I’m thrilled to be
part of ARC Prize 2024 and appreciate the detailed resources you’ve provided.
I’ve already subscribed to the newsletter and joined the Discord server to
stay updated and engaged with the community. The support and guidance from the
ARC Prize team are invaluable as we dive into solving the ARC-AGI challenges.

I just wanted to say thanks for uploading the data and hosting the comp., I
got quite close to a fully-working solution for this exact thing around 1.5
years ago. The models were good but with work & time constraints I had to quit
building the dataset in its entirety. So, this is like the missing link in a
huge project I was actually sad to have to leave on the backburner! Thanks
again, you have no idea how much of a relief this is -.- Pete.

Hi - maybe dumb question. Say someone hits 85%, will their solution be
revealed publicly at the time?
It seems to me it ought be concealed until the end of the competition.
Otherwise, couldn't people just piggyback off of their solution and provide
incremental improvements to split the prize?
I couldn't find this covered anywhere, I could well have missed it.


### [Greg Kamradt](/gregkamradt)

Only solutions which want to be considered and eligible for a prize must be
open sourced. This must be done by the end of the competition. Anyone can open
their solution up before that, but it would allow for piggy backing like
you're saying.

Wish you guys could score it privately first.
Yk what kaggle needs here, and many other things need the same solution…


### [Coachhhhhomg](/mynamewomab)

Sorry, I feel like I'm being annoying.
A potential process flow:  
1) I submit, you score, I can choose not to os, thus making it ineligible for
the moment, but you guys see the solution, and it stays closed source for now.
If this isn't an option, it seems I must either  
1) wait until the end of the competition, or  
2) os it as it's submitted
Isn't piggybacking still an issue with 2)?
I appreciate your time replying to so many q's.

Kaggle cannot open-source your code automatically, because you own the
copyright.
If you win the competition, you'll be notified after Nov 10. You'll have a
week to respond. It's in the "Rules" section.
At that point, you'll have 3 options:
  1. Open-source your code
  2. Explain your approach only to Kaggle and show them the code
  3. Do neither
Depending on what you choose, you'll (probably)
  1. Get the prize
  2. Stay on the leaderboard, but won't get the prize
  3. Get removed from the leaderboard


### [Coachhhhhomg](/mynamewomab)

Yes - sorry to be so obtuse/nitty. But it will be scored on submission, even
if code is kept closed source for the moment?


### [Coachhhhhomg](/mynamewomab)
arrow_drop_up0
  * format_quote

And the score will be public, even if solution isn't? Just want to make sure I
understand. And thank you so much.


### [Oleg Trott](/olegtrott)

Right, unless you choose to make your "notebook" public, it should be private
(website bugs, security breaches and leaks aside).
If you really want to make sure, you can use a compiled language like C++, and
just upload a binary.

Hi, hope you're having a good day. Two enquires if you don't mind..
  1. Concerning Leaks & security breaches… I assume we do not need to be concerned with… I don't know… Let's say an employee of kaggle who could potentially/theoretically have access to said "private" notebook… Then could proceed to forward result to a colleague, friend, accomplice etc… Who in turn would then submit same/tweaked data.
  2. Regarding c++ compilation. Could you please elaborate further. No need to go into great detail, just a quick run-down would be fine.
Thanks in advance for your response.

Regarding 1: Unlikely. But if it did happen, it would probably reflect with
more… **zeal** on the Leaderboard.  
Regarding 2: If you are referring to the idea of uploading a compiled binary,
you will probably be in over your head, depending on how close you can get to
matching the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the docker container
running the private test dataset. The one guy that ever went with C++ and won
(in 2020) compiled the C++ source as part of his Jupyter Notebook code. So
even _he_ didn't try uploading the compiled binary.


### [Oleg Trott](/olegtrott)
arrow_drop_up1
  * format_quote
  * link
Sure. Compile your C++ code on AMD64 Linux. Consider using "-static". Upload
the binary as a "dataset" and attach it to your Python notebook. From your
Python notebook, unpack, "chmod +x" and run the binary.


### [James Huddle](/jameshuddle)
arrow_drop_up1

There might be security issues that keep such code from being considered. So,
ask questions and start small.

Super exciting! Is the dataset the same as the previous ARC competition on
Kaggle?

Hey! Yes, it is still ARC-AGI-1 (we are starting to version the datasets w/
Francois in anticipation for a v2 after v1 learnings).
A few problems have been corrected, you can check those out via Francois

Does anyone have a deep understanding of how the evaluation metrics work for
this competition? How should we optimize our solutions to perform well
