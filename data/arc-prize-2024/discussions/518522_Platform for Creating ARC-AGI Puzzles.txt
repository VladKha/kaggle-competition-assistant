### Platform for Creating ARC-AGI Puzzles
Hi.
I've created an app where you can design and create ARC-AGI Puzzles:
<https://arc-agi-puzzle-maker.vercel.app/>
# ARC-AGI Puzzle Maker
As it stands currently, this is a robust implementation that allows users to
create three example puzzles and one test puzzle. You can thereafter export
the puzzle to JSON and use it with the ARC testing interface.
The ARC dataset has been a great benchmark for testing abstract reasoning
capabilities of our current AI systems. However, I think there is great
potential in expanding it with more human-designed puzzles of new patterns and
increased complexity.


## Scaling
I am interested in scaling this into a broader platform where we can aggregate
human-designed puzzles into an open source dataset. Ideally, I'd like to
implement saving, sharing, and collaboration on puzzles. I'd like to add a
rating system for identifying challenging and innovative puzzles.
Generally speaking, I really enjoy solving these puzzles, and I have found a
few of them to be challenging. I would personally like to have a resource
where I can go through and solve other people's puzzles. I could not find a
platform like this, so I thought I would build one instead.


## Collaboration
If you're interested in a resource like this, please upvote or comment in this
thread. Furthermore, try out the app and share any feedback you have. Thanks!


## Features to Implement
  * Color by Dragging 
  * Naming, Tagging, and Descriptions for Puzzles


## Updates
(7/9/24) - Added some functionality for playtesting puzzles from import or
creation. Minor changes to creating puzzles and UI. Some known bugs include
'Return to Create' not carrying the playtesting puzzle into the creating page
and coloring issues in the playtest environment.
I have been a little sick, so I have not been able to scale this as quickly as
I had hoped. I hope to have made a platform where we can start creating and
collecting puzzles by the end of the week.
(7/18/24) - For anyone who might still be following this thread, I am
continuing to build out a platform for compiling these puzzles. I am extremely
proud of the work I have done so far, and I am very excited to share it with
you all soon. I hope that I can deploy something in the next few days. Until
then, I am keeping up the grind. Cheers!

Excellent editor. Is your project open source?
I have added your editor here

I have made a something like that. Except there is no editor for creating new
tasks.

When you said, "â€¦where I can go through and solveâ€¦" did you mean "you" or did
you mean "your program"? (I cannot wait to go to awesome#editors, btw.)

It was a quote from the OP, that I responded to, with a link.
Oh, I'm not there yet. My program cannot solve these puzzles.

I like to solve the puzzles myself ðŸ˜…

Thanks for adding mine! A lot of cool stuff on the page there. I was hoping to
establish more of a foundation before open-sourcing the editor, so not yet.
Your platform is great! You have a great aggregation of puzzles there. Thanks
for sharing!

what kind of foundation? like a backend where users can store their creations?


### [Christian Jones](/cjchristianjones)

Well I think there are a couple more features I'd like to implement, like
color by dragging and importing puzzles to playtest. And then I will add
backend functionalities for saving and aggregating puzzles.

Another feature that could be interesting would be the possibility to download
the history of interaction with the image creation (especially for the
solution). Not as useful as "solving" history, but maybe it can give some
insights on how humans reason while doing this kind of tasks.

My editor records the user interaction. There are a bit more than 6000
interaction history files.

The editor is here

That's great! Exactly what I was looking for! Very nice project!

Great work! I think it would be nice to have the possibility to add metadata
such as tags (maybe using a common tag source?) and short
descriptions/solutions: this would greatly help NLP-based approaches! Looking
forward to see the progress on your platform

Agreed. Adding tags to the list!

Clean interface, great look! Nicely done. Naturally, ideas abound. I'd like to
see a tiny [>] button between input and output that just copies everything
(rows, columns, colors) over. There's so much I'd like to see that would just
spoil your nice clean look. Wish I could upvote more than once!

That is a fantastic idea, and I will add that to the front of a growing list
of feature ideas. Thanks!
