### Black always "null"?
From the examples it seems like black is always a null type variable. ie there
will not be rules like Black to blue. But this is a bad assumption to make
given the nature of the test, have people come across examples where black is
not a null?

I think that's generally true, but perhaps not 100%; check out 272f95fa for
example - the entire black sections change (based on what section it is within
blue, but still); the entire black section changes.
