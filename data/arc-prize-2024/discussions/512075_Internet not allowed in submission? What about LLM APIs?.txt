### Internet not allowed in submission? What about LLM APIs?
I am a bit confused.  
This Competition is supposed to prove that AGI like performance is possible,
but we are not allowed to use the internet at all?
Am I supposed to train my own GPT4 for this real quick or how is this supposed
to work?
Can someone clarify how I am supposed to use the APIs?

Correct, no internet access is allowed (otherwise you could just call your own
server and leak the entire private test set).
Instead, you'll have to use open source models in the limited time window.
They won't be as powerful as the APIs, but that's part of the challenge! In a
couple of podcasts, the competition hosts talk about how the largest LLMs
still have a lot of trouble with ARC, so a large LLM may or may not even be
helpful with this task.
You're also of course free to try it out with any LLM API outside of Kaggle -
if you can get good performance on the public eval set, I'm sure the
competition hosts would be very interested to hear that result as well!

Alright, makes sense. I think for an intelligent AGI-like system you still
would rather have a strong underlying model than a bad one (notebook can not
even run Llama 70B) but ok. I get it.

That's not completely true
