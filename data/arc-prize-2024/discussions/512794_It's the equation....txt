### It's the equation...
I know Kaggle may not be the place to look, but I would like some diehard
followers of the old school, back when it was just called "AI," to consider
joining me. I can't help but notice how François sat there with only one
lightsaber and defended the cause for 90+ minutes. Can you join my team,
François? Serious, unless rules or regs stop you, I would really like to push
it forward. Plus anyone else up to 5, I guess. It may not last, creative
differences or whatever, but it could be the one true sound. Think about it.
There is so much to know.

I was thinking about the movie, "Temple Grandin," about the woman of that
name. I think it's an incredible movie, and it relates to AGI (and,
Ironically, this competition) for two reasons. First, Temple Grandin is a
fiercely intelligent human, who also happens to be on the autistic spectrum.
Simply communicating with her (when she was a child) was a Herculean struggle.
But her mother persevered, because of love. This struggle to communicate might
sound familiar for those considering this challenge. The other reason the
movie relates (in my opinion) is when she is deciding what to do with her
life, she decides to work with cattle. And in attempting to understand what
the cattle are thinking and feeling, at one point she gets down on her hands
and knees and walks through a processing chute. There, she experienced the
world the way that the cattle did. …From their perspective. This process can
be very enlightening. I looked for that clip (it's truly iconic) on youtube,
but there's not a lot of that movie out there for free. You have to get the
DVD. Actually, this works <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvWKKDG55YA> … I
did find a very interesting clip of Dr. Temple Grandin giving a presentation
on "thinking like an animal." She says a lot of profound things. Some people,
myself included, find her verbal delivery to be off-putting. But the movie
(with Claire Danes performing miracles) does a lot to warm you to her cadence.
Here she is in her 70's now, giving a "classic Temple" presentation. If you
can see the movie, it's really great. Here's the talk:

This may be the only team where you get to hear one-liners such as  
Intelligence is syntax-free  
Intelligent beings _use_ syntax, the way a hungry person uses a spoon  
It would be a mistake** to confuse the spoon for something yummy to eat  
**a pretty big mistake, if you ask John Searle
