### Empty outputs
Is it right that a correct answer should contain at least one cell? In other
words, I would like to know whether it is guaranteed that (where `x` is a
correct test output for one test input):
    
    
    len(x.shape) == 2
    x.shape[0] >= 1
    x.shape[1] >= 1
    
    
    content_copy
Knowing this will help me simplify some of my code. Thanks.

The smallest matrix dimension is 1x1. You will not have an empty matrix,
either as input or output. You should not have to do any checking to see if
either matrix is (or will be) [[]]. And all matrices will be normal (numpy
acceptable) matrices, where the number of cells (columns) is the same for each
row.
That said, [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]] is a valid input or output. So it
sort of depends on how you define "Empty".
