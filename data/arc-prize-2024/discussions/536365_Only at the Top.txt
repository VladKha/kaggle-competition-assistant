### Only at the Top
Congratulations absolutely in order for the MindsAI team, who (one leg at a
time, like everyone else) once again broke the world's record ARC-AGI score,
first with 46.5 and then 47. Well done!! Again!
(What a downer topic! Fixed.)

In a blink - now 48 for MindsAI. They go up so fast.
