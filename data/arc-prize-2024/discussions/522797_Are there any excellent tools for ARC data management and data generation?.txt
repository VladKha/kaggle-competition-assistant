### Are there any excellent tools for ARC data management and data generation?
I have some hobby-level experience with UI, and if there are no such tools
available, I'm considering creating one myself.  
The following discussion about datasets was very informative:

I would appreciate it if you could share any other past examples or resources.  
Thank you in advance for your help.

I would like to propose the following features for the user interface.
**Function 1: Load Data**
  1. Allow users to upload data in JSONL format.
**Feature 2: Category Visualization**
  1. Enable the application of a custom Python script to categorize the data.
     * Users should be able to test this functionality within the UI.
  2. Provide a visualization of the data based on the categories.
**Function 3: Apply Solver**
  1. Implement a solver feature.
  2. Indicate the solver's results with visual markers:
     * A green mark for correctly solved problems.
     * A red mark for unsolved problems.
The above UI will be a great help in understanding and improving the existing
solver.
In fact, I am considering a completely different methodology for solving the
problem.

Thank you for your response.  
In the structure I'm currently considering, I'd like to be able to show:
  * Data loading
  * Correct/Incorrect answers
  * Metadata  
I want to be able to show these in a format.  
Is it necessary to run Python on the UI? I'm thinking that it might be
sufficient to just provide the output data to the UI. What do you think?
