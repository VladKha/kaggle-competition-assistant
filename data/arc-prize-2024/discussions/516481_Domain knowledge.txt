### Domain knowledge
Hi guys, i have seem several examples of inputs and outputs a while ago. As i
remember most of the time i was able to figure the pattern by looking the
first input-output pair and many times the second input-output pair. Are there
hard puzzles that someone needs more than two input-output pairs to figure out
the pattern? Another question, are all tests in train/eval/test sets going to
be different or there can be common tests across the sets?

Tasks that have 3 or more examples, where having fewer may make the puzzle
unsolvable.

I don't understand your "Another question"?

Hey thanks for the reply. I mean can we notice the exact same pattern of a
task in the train set also in the test set? Or the patterns there will be all
different?

If you notice that one of test puzzles uses exactly the same pattern as task
in public dataset, then IMHO applying the same algorithm should give correct
solution. Since the goal of competition is reaching 85% of successfully solved
puzzles, each puzzle should have one correct solution only. But I suspect
there won't be many such puzzles, if any.

Another question, is it guaranteed that the biggest grid is 30x30 or it can be
as well bigger?

Min is 1x1 and Max is 30x30

Often a task with have several in-out examples to help rule out alternative
solutions.  
Hopefully there should be one clear solution.  
An AI program might find, for example, the top-left square is always red when
it is XYZ type of solution, but completely misses the general pattern that the
task is trying to test on. More examples can help to rule out those wrong
hypotheses.  
Harder problems may need more examples to make it less ambiguous.
