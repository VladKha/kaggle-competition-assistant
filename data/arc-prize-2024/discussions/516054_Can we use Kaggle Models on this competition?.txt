### Can we use Kaggle Models on this competition?
Are we allowed to use Kaggle models like Gemma 2, Gemma on this competition?  
Link for these models: [https://www.kaggle.com/models?lang=16895&fine-
tunable=true&orderby=hotness](https://www.kaggle.com/models?lang=16895&fine-
tunable=true&orderby=hotness)
I know we are not allowed to use internet for submissions, but was wondering
if we could use Kaggle models.

Yep! You can either use kaggle models or other open source models, including
your own models, that you upload as a dataset. They do have to follow the open
source limitations in the rules (so check there for details), but yes, outside
models are allowed.
