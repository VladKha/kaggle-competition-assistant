### What OS LLM models have you tried?
I saw some notebooks using both proprietary and open models. My question is:
did you try to switch the model and measure the performance?  
In addition (very important if, like me, you like to work on local machines):
did you noticed a drop in performance for smaller models (as one would
expect)?
