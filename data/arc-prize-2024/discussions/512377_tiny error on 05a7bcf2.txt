### tiny error on 05a7bcf2
05a7bcf2 (I think it's the 4th puzzle) has an error on the first-round output.
The red shape, lower-right should be slightly different than it is. I have not
checked the json for similar configuration.
    
    
    is:      should be:

Yes, exactly, I see it too. The red shape on the right, which has moved down -
in the first example. Error in `json`, because pictures are drawn using `json`
(at least in my notebook)

And yet…. You were probably able to solve that puzzle (me too). So "slop
tolerance" is probably important in the AGI code. Not a surprise, but I wonder
how many people had that "top of mind" as they thought through solving this. I
looked at the first four puzzles. I stopped after this one because it was
killing my hand to click all of the squares that needed clicking. But also
stopped to think it through a little. One in four with an error? I'm sure
that's the only such error. Seriously. Imagine what the result might be if 25%
of the json files had a tiny error of some kind. The kind of result that would
stop a more pedantic piece of code in its tracks. I'm sure it's much lower
that 25%. I always overthink these things.

You just went straight to the eval set. In fact, I had previously viewed only
the train set and did not notice any errors there (although I did not
specifically look for them).  
In this case, of course, the organizers must correct this error, but the main
thing is that there are no errors in the hidden test :)
