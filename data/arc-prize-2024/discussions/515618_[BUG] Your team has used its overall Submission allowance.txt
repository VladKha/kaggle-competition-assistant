### [BUG] Your team has used its overall Submission allowance
> Your team has used its overall Submission allowance (68 of 38), please try

In this case, I have to wait 15 days to be able to submit ðŸ˜…
It's most likely a bug related to changing the limit from 5 to 2.

This is affecting us too.

Here's the summary of the problem and our fix.
Initially, when we made this change, we thought that changing the daily
submission limit would only apply _forward_ \-- we expected all teams to be
able to submit 2x/day regardless of how many times they had previously
submitted.
However, Kaggle's backend logic checks `total_count <= daily_limit *
days_elapsed`, which means that a small number of teams that had high
submissions counts found themselves unable to submit. This was unintended.
Kaggle is not able to modify this logic for this competition. So what we are
doing instead is bumping the submission limit to 3x/day, which we consider to
be a reasonable amount in this context. As a result, all teams except two
should be able to submit right away. One team (yours) will be able to submit
in 1-2 days. The other one will take a week. We'll be reaching out directly to
affected teams with more information.

Thanks :-)  
I have a suggestion that might help other yet affected teams.

A lot of us faced errors such as "csv not found" For example, I have 14 subs
with errors, maybe deleting those (if any) for affected teams can reduce their
total submitted amount and reduce the waiting time.

I had something like 25 of those too.

This is a fair way to implement the change - maybe the comms could be better ?

It makes sense to do this if you want to give all participants the same
maximum number of attempts to make the competition fair under the same rules.
The problem is that the conditions have changed, not that this is unfair.

Itâ€™s a bug, all participants had 5 submissions from the starting of the
competition and you could have used yours daily. Its not like I had more than
others.
I donâ€™t see how it is fair for me to wait two weeks to submit as a penalty for
me using my allowed daily 5 subs before ðŸ™‚
So it is just a bug in the submission system.
