### Measuring submission runtime with Distill Web Monitor
Currently, Kaggle does not show the submission runtime, it only shows the time
when the submission was made. Being able to measure the submission runtime is
important to optimize the submission configuration and maximize the
leaderboard score.
On this post, I'm going to share my method to measure submission runtime.
  1. Install [Distill Monitor Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/distill-web-monitor/inlikjemeeknofckkjolnjbpehgadgge?hl=en&pli=1). It is an extension that allows to monitor changes in websites.
  2. Go to <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024/submissions>
  3. Click on the extension and select `Monitor full page`

  4. Click on Open Webpage Selector settings

  5. Add the following regex: `(\d+\.\d{2})|(Version \d+)` This will filter all the website content except from notebook versions and scores.

  6. Select your monitor interval, alerts and you are done!
