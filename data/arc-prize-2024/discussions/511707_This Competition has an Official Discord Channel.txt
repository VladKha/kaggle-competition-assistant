### This Competition has an Official Discord Channel
In addition to this competition forum, you can continue the discussion in our
official Kaggle Discord Server here:
# [discord.gg/kaggle](http://discord.gg/kaggle)
The Discord is a great place to ask getting started questions, chat about the
nuances of this competition, and connect with potential team mates. Learn more
about Discord at our [announcement
here](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/429933). Here are a few
things to keep in mind though:
**1\. Discord Competition Channels are 'Public'**
Discord channels for specific competitions are considered 'public' spaces
where you are allowed to talk about competition details (it will not count as
private sharing).
**2\. Discord Competition Channels are Not Monitored by Staff**
Kaggle Staff and Hosts running competitions will not monitor Discord or be
available to answer questions in Discord. Always post important questions in
the forums.
**3\. Keep the Good Stuff on the Forums**
Please keep important questions, insights, writeups, and other valuable
conversation on the Kaggle forums. Discord is intended to be a more casual
space to discuss competitions and help each other, we want to keep all the
best information on the forums.
**4\. Remember to never privately share competition code or data**
Please remember that private sharing of competition code or data is, as
always, not permitted. Code sharing must always be done publicly through the
Kaggle forums/notebooks.
I hope you’ll join us to chat on Discord soon!

The creation of an official Discord channel for the ARC Prize 2024 is a
valuable addition for informal discussions and team-building. However, it's
crucial to keep detailed insights and critical questions on the Kaggle forums
to benefit the entire community. Let’s also ensure we follow the guidelines
regarding code and data sharing to maintain a fair and collaborative
environment. Looking forward to engaging with everyone on both platforms!
