### sharing my architecture so people better than me can give it a shot
one day of brain farting and a night of sleep and i ended up with a (in my
opinion) quite simple architecture that still needs work to flesh it out
nonetheless, it hits me when i am manually complaining the demo task on the
ARC website and analysing my approach to the problems, i realised that i am
just making up plans for completing the task before even starting to click my
solution in to the squares, then not too efficiently "make" my solution step
by stap.  
TL;DR  
this is some squiggle line that is my plan

Perhaps I didn’t fully understand your approach. Based on my understanding, I
think the part about 'evaluation criteria' in your steps seems somewhat vague?

Kinda hard to interpret. Please share a flowchart, if possible.
