### Can i pre-train outside of the submission
This is my first ever kaggle competition, mostly participating just to try it
out. I am wondering what the exact rules are for submissions, I see that the
run time is limited to 12 hours. Does this include training? In other words
would I be allowed to train and save the weights in an input file?

You are allowed to use pretrained models. The 12h limit is just for creating a
submission.
