### Reducing the time limit
This will probably be an unpopular opinion, but I would like to suggest that
future ARC competitions reduce the time limit of 12 hours runtime for solving
the puzzles. This incentivizes brute-force search approaches, which I don't
think are in the spirit of AGI. Having gone through all the tasks, I spent on
average 5-10s to solve each puzzle, with a max of 30s or so on some of the
more challenging ones - mentally of course.
I know this challenge is just a stepping stone on the road to AGI, but I would
find it discouraging if the ultimate winning approach takes ~7m per task for
something a human can do much faster. I would welcome a much reduced time
limit as the approach I'm working towards takes <1s per task. That being said
I'm aiming to submit next year if time permits, so take my opinion for what it
is.

Reducing time limit will hinder the progress even further. Winning submissions
will most probably make use of large models and might also need multiple
specialized models. Kaggle GPUs are great but still running big models will
definitely need more time to execute.

No amount of brute force can help, if you are not searching correct space
state or if space state is too large to be exhaustively searched. Therefore
there is no reason to reduce time limit, at least as long as solutions are
well below target score of 85%.
