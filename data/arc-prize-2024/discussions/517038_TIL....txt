### TIL...
Solved yet another challenge. No major achievement. It _was_ difficult… And I
was about to "just walk away" from it, when I realized, "I have learned a new
thing." Not _just_ the challenge. I learned an interesting rule regarding
colored objects on a grid. It's a new rule for me, which has not occurred in a
long time. Here it is:
    
    
    If you have an object
    And that object (and its colors) are symmetrical to any diagonal
    Then flipping the object along an orthogonal (LR or UD) axis
    Is identical to rotating the object 90 degrees.

A quick mental check suggests the obverse is true, as well.  
Flipping a LR or UD symmetrical object along a diagonal == rotating it.
