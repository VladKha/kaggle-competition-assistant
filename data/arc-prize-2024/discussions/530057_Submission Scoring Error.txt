### Submission Scoring Error
[@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt)
[@inversion](https://www.kaggle.com/inversion), I'm stuck handling the topic
error. The same model inference after committing is giving valid and invalid
submissions. The difference is that the valid submission is trained on a few
data points (just for submission checking) while invalid submission is tuned
on much larger data. Also verified all the generated outputs for both json
files through array testing including the ones having multiple outputs. Both
files also have the same size. Despite these checks, still can't figure out
the bug. I have attached both JSON files for your perusal.

The same submissions (the rejected ones) are accepted now on the third
attempt. Is it a bug?
