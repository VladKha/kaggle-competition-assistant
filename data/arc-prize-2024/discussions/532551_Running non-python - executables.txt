### Running non-python / executables
I have questions regarding running non-python/executables.
In the top 2020 solution, the executable is created by compiling the c++ code
with `g++`.
Can I just pre-compile it or is compilation/build needed due to container
checking if executable is created in the container?
Most non-c/c++ codes requires its own build command other than `g++` or `gcc`.
Is installing the build tool allowed if pre-building the executable is not
allowed?

I never found anything in the rules against non-Python, so I assumed "do
whatever you want". I added Node binaries and TypeScript as a dataset or
whatever, and was surprisingly able to execute from Python. It allowed me to
move much faster. I don't think this would be against the spirit of the
competition either: an LLM solution will most likely be a black box solution,
as least here we have readable code.
I eventually moved to Python though since pretty committed to the deep
learning approach for now.
