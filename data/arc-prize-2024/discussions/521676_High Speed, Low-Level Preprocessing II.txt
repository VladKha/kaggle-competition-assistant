### High Speed, Low-Level Preprocessing II
I call this process "whitewashing."  
It replaces all the color values with 1's. Quickly.
    
    
    import numpy as np
    rng = np.random.default_rng(12345)
    
    
    content_copy
This code:
    
    
    rints = rng.integers(low=4, size=(10,10))  # <--- 2D array of size==100
    ones = np.ones(rints.shape, dtype=int)
    zz = ones^(ones//(rints+1))
    
    
    content_copy
takes about 6.7 microseconds
This code:
    
    
    rints = rng.integers(low=4, size=(100,100))  # <--- 2D array of size==10,000
    ones = np.ones(rints.shape, dtype=int)
    zz = ones^(ones//(rints+1))

You think you want np.arange()…  
This is really what you want. You want a neat-looking 4D array that's easy to
make.  
You want dint()
    
    
    def dint(start, shape):
      s = np.array(list(shape)).prod()
      a = np.arange(start,start+s).reshape(shape)
      return a
    
    dint(101,(3,2,3,5))
    
    
    content_copy
