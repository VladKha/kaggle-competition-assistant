### Cause and Effect
That's what's been bothering me! Skimming Chollet's paper (for the 6th or 7th
time) I read (again) where he said that time was not really a requisite prior‚Ä¶
Yeah, sort of‚Ä¶ Each ARC i/o pair is precisely and exactly an abstraction of
cause and effect. Every one. Even the one that starts off with a completely
blank matrix. The entirety of the human condition as described by cause and
effect (there are actually other descriptions, but I digress), each
input/output pair represents cause and effect. You see the before state
(input). You do not have the benefit of knowing the cause (that's the puzzle),
but you get to see the effect in all its glory (output). Most of the tasks are
simple enough for humans to construct correctly-sized stories about what
happened. When there is (obvious? planned?) ambiguity, you get more training.
When the (internal, human) story can "produce" the desired "effect," you get
confetti (my fave).

And I'm curious, how did you make the connection between the whole idea of
"Cause & Effect" and this ARC tasks of input and output pairs?  
I have been listening to the podcast titled "Machine Learning Street Talk" and
that's how i heard about Judea Pearl etc‚Ä¶.

I like MLST‚Ä¶ Haven't listened (to much of anyone's podcasts) recently. I was
looking at Chollet's paper again, and picked up (again) where he stressed that
"time" was not a major concern (horribly misquoting. sorry) in all of the
tasks. And thinking about how time _does_ relate to the tasks is an
overwhelming intoxication. _Something_ about those tasks is very close,
indeed, to time. But what was I seeing? That was the question I asked myself.
Cause and Effect leapt from the volume of ideas and immediately stuck to every
task. That's my closest analog to how I made that connection, prior to being
introduced to Judea Pearl, who I still have not read. It was a tributary of
time.

That's really cool you've made the connection even without reading Judea Pearl
or likewise and approaching each task from input to output as a series of
cause and effects‚Ä¶.

from page 49, where the focus is "goal-directed" priors,
    
    
    "While ARC does not feature the concept of time, many of the input/output grids can be
    effectively modeled by humans as being the starting and end states of a process that in-
    volves intentionality (e.g. figure 9). As such, the goal-directedness prior may not be strictly
    necessary to solve ARC, but it is likely to be useful."

So. He almost calls it by name. But I'm not talking about human priors, per
se. I'm talking about every set of every task of any ARC dataset. Which is
different, IMO. It's pretty deep, and while it may not be strictly necessary
to solve ARC, it is likely to be useful!

Hello James Huddle,
I've been the reading the book, The book of why, the new science of cause and
effect by Judea Pearl..  
I think there are valuable insights based on what you have written‚Ä¶

Your name is JasonChris1988, which is the only thing to make me go in the
following direction‚Ä¶  
"Oh, he must have been born in 1988." I was born in 1962, which is 26 years
prior. February 26, 1962. Never heard of Judea Pearl, so googling, I read
"Professor Judea Pearl is a Professor of Computer Science at University of
California, Los Angeles. He is a leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Pearl
invented Bayesian networks,"‚Ä¶ Nice. I thought Bayes invented them because I am
an idiot. Anyway, Pearl himself is 88, having been born in 1936. It just keeps
going around.  
As for "cause and effect," I just noticed it. But Chollet has been working
these images for half a decade. I wonder if Pearl stayed connected‚Ä¶ 88 is
getting on in years. Frankly, not surprised that someone cutting deep into AI
(like Pearl) would get very familiar with cause and effect. Thank you for
mentioning these things. It is a gradual awakening.

Since everything is connected to everything else (DaVinci's quote)
**Five years ago** (while Chollet was working on these images and far before
that movie), I posted on Kaggle:  
[Barbie developer and Judea
Pearl.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mpwolke/cusersmarildownloadsearningcsv/discussion/115430)
For the record, I was also born in 1962. This topic is almost a Bacon's law
(Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon : )

Nice! I read your piece on Dr. Barbara Mattel, an looking down saw the single
word, "hotness". Calling Dr. Jung‚Ä¶ Loved your description of her internal
organ tradeoffs. Classic!

I was inspired by some of my co-workers when Avatar movie was launched. My
"colleague" said that she wanted to be like the Na‚Äôvi, due to the Na‚Äôvi female
body shape.  
I had to explain to her that she would have to opt by her liver,
spleen/pancreas. Only some of her internal organs, because Na‚Äôvi's bodies
don't have space for ALL the organs that human beings need.
Very likely, on that time people started to photoshop their social media
images to achieve an irrealistic aspect they find it's the kind we had to
pursue.
That's the problem that civilizations face when they simply stop to think and
reflect, no matter how we improve all technology available.

Yes, you're right about my birth year and quite good at deducting the cause
and effect. I'm glad, you have gotten to introduced to Judea Pearl,let's see
where this cause leads‚Ä¶. üòÅ

When I was in the 5th grade, I learned (from every one of my classmates, as
they read their essays) that '62 was a good year for wine. At first, it seemed
odd that they would use that line. It was the 5th grade. How would they know a
good year from a bad one? Of course I had to add that to my oral presentation
as well. Every 11-yr-old who uttered those words KILLED! (It was an easy
room)‚Ä¶ I had to get those easy laughs, so I chatgpt'd my classmates (all born
in 1962, it turns out!) (yep, I cheated before cheatin' was cool)

Hi Soltani,
Is that?
[On the Measure of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01547)
Three months ago I tried to summarize it:  
[ARC: Generalization Difficulty. Computation efficiency. Core Knowledge
priors.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2024/discussion/511743)

Thank you, Marilia!  
The thrust of my post was really not so much a comment on Chollet's (great)
paper, as it was this: Of all the things that have been said about ARC
(including Francois' comment on time) I don't think I've seen anyone make the
"cause - effect" connection. It seems trivial and obvious, now (please forgive
me if you have made that point already, whoever you are), but the realization
hit me somewhat bluntly, so I "discussed"!

Hi Huddle,
Your post is valuable, worthy and the cause/effect is very interesting.  
Besides, I copy/post so many things that I even remember that I've published
that. In other words, I didn't made any point about this subject. I simply
summarized what I read. At least, you reflected and analyzed it.
And worst, I don't remember the content of that paper. It seems I should read
it again. Shame on me.
What I will remember in that competition is that I waited almost four years to
make those charts and since Kaggle team changed the files I wasn't able to
display them by myself too.
I'm just a beginner that doesn't understand most part that I try to publish.
For the record, it's great to read your topic .

So much to say! Thank you for the links, Marilia. I haven't read your summary
- looking forward to that.  
My response was to you and Soltani. And it was such a spaghetti-coded melange
of 'you's, how could anyone parse it? Apologies for that! Have a great day.
(Thank you for the nice words!)

I _did_ read your paper back when you posted, and promptly forgot about it.
And here's why: It's the "program generation," part, with which most
intelligent people in "the field" would agree. It put me off in my original
read of the original 2019 paper, as well. It's not your fault for summarizing,
or even Francois' fault for originally writing that. I understand it, and,
yes: AI (the real deal) will be something very much like that‚Ä¶ a code
generating, code running, program. I just find recent references to that
process to be personally painful, because that is what I was trying to
accomplish in 1992. Thank you for the summary. Do you prefer to use last
names, in these exchanges? Thank you, Prata!

Hi James,
No fault at all. You can use whatever you want (Prata, mar√≠lia, mpwolke
commented with the at symbol or not)  
In 1992, I was still praticing (as a Dental doctor). I'd never expect to learn
anything in this programming field.
In fact, as I mentioned above, my only "experience" is on Kaggle where I spend
many hours trying to make intuitively things that I don't get most part. And
often, I forget what I copied/posted too.
Now, we can "measure my programming intelligence" (applying Chollet's title),
better say my lack of it: )
