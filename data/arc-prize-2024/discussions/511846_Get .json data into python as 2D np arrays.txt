### Get .json data into python as 2D np arrays
Hey all,
Just wanted to mention a package I've created a few years ago to simplify
reading and visualizing the data from python:
<https://github.com/ikamensh/arc-py> .
It essentially packages the original arc files and few utilities to read them
+ plotting and eval code. See the README on github if interested :) Hope it
will save a few hours to challenge participants. If API is not what you would
expect, feel free to create an issue with a proposal (or even a PR).
Best of luck on new challenge!

Actually found this package which appears to follow same idea but maybe has
more features: <https://github.com/mxbi/arckit>
