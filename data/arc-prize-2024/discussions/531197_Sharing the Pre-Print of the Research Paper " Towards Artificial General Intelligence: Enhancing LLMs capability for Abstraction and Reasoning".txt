  * What is an `AGI-driven module`?
  * What is the accuracy of your approach in the hidden test set?

The accuracy is to be based on testing on Competition dataset. Currently work
is in progress. AGI block is to transform problem statements into prompting
for the LLMs. It should pre-process problems and extract useful insights and
pass it to llm. I am planning to add all the details once the competition
ends.

It seems to me like a very confusing name. I don't see any relation between
AGI and a module that creates prompts for an LLM.
Good luck anyway!

Actually, writing code to "create prompts" seems like a natural for AGI. Try
doing anything like that without a serious chunk of AGI magic and you probably
won't get very far. Very likely my opinion is flawed, here. It just seems if
you have **_enough AGI_** to analyze a problem statement, create a prompt
(from basically nothing but the problem statement, right?) in order to get
details from an LLM, and then put that response to good use, you could have
skipped the LLM part!! Alternatively, if you don't have enough AGI to create
the LLM prompt, it doesn't seem like such a shortcoming. People are prompting
LLMs with their human-level intelligence to try to get a good solution to a
problem, and that seems to be coming up short, as well!
