### Paper submission and making notebooks public
In the overview page, it is mentioned that the paper submission deadline is 10
Nov, but in the submission form it is said 12 Nov. So, is it a mistake, or I
should submit the Notebook link by 10 Nov then make it public by 12 Nov? What
if the submission is a PDF or archiveX link, what should I do exactly before
10 Nov and before 12 Nov?  
In the submission form of the paper award, it is mentioned that Notebooks must
be public by 12 Nov. Is it the Notebook containing description of the paper,
or the Notebook containing the submitted code solution? or both?  
Is it possible to just write the link of the paper PDF as a comment inside the
Notebook of the submitted code solution and making it public by 12 Nov? Or
attach the PDF to the Notebook (is it possible)?  
What if I am not going to participate in the paper award, should I still make
the Notebook of the code solution public by 12 Nov? I probably understand that
from another discussion but is it mentioned somewhere in the rules? Where is
that?

Hey! Greg from the ARC Prize team here. Lots of questions. First off, the
competition ends on Nov 10. Use that to anchor all questions and answers.
Let's go through them!

Good call out. If it says the 12th this is a mistake. Can you link me to where
you see the 12th? I don't see it. You need to submit the notebook and paper by
the 10th

A link is fine! You can submit the link on the

Papers must be submitted by the 10th, then notebook must be public shortly
afterwards. Of course we would love them open sooner than that.

You can do that! But we also request that you submit it through the normal
google form as well. This is required for us to manage all submissions.

Only submissions wishing to be eligible for prize money (which we expect will
be most), need to open source their code at the end of the competition. There
is a small grace period after the competition ends to do this.
