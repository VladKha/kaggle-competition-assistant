### Daily Submission Limit Change
Hey ARC Prize contestants!
Greg from the ARC Prize team here. We are reducing the daily submission limit
from 5 to 3 submissions per day.
**Why we're making this change:**
  1. **Discourage test probing** : We want to ensure that the competition remains focused on developing robust, generalizable solutions rather than overfitting to the private evaluation data through repeated submissions.
  2. **Maintain competition integrity** : This change helps mitigate the risk of model selection bias, where participants might inadvertently learn enough about the private test set through frequent submissions to gain an unfair advantage.
  3. **Encourage thoughtful iterations** : By limiting submissions, we hope to promote deliberate and well-considered improvements to your models.
**What this means for you:**
  * You will now have 3 submission opportunities per day, not 5.
  * This change reduces the total potential submissions over the remaining competition period by approximately 40%.
  * We encourage you to use the public evaluation set for more frequent testing and iteration.
We believe this change strikes a reasonable balance between allowing for
necessary iterations and maintaining the integrity of the challenge. It also
aligns our competition more closely with best practices in machine learning
competitions.
If you want to test more frequently we’ve made a secondary leaderboard, [ARC-
AGI-Pub](https://arcprize.org/arc-agi-pub), just for this check out our
[launch post](https://arcprize.org/blog/introducing-arc-agi-public-
leaderboard) for more information.
We appreciate your understanding and continued participation in ARC Prize. If
you have any questions, you can reach us at:
[team@arcprize.org](mailto:team@arcprize.org)
Good luck in the competition and in advancing AI research!

Just for visibility in the spirit of fairness, I think I'm still able to
submit 5 times daily through the "Submit" button in the notebook. Submitted my
third submission a minute ago. I am seeing the 2 submission limit when
clicking the "Submit Prediction" button in the competition overview though

Thank you for this. We were unaware of this and we appreciate it. I'll dig
into it

[@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt)
[@maggiemd](https://www.kaggle.com/maggiemd) I can't submit because I am 30
subs over limit :D !  
Please fix this. It's already a new day.  
Thanks

[@maggiemd](https://www.kaggle.com/maggiemd) it's now 3 days without the
ability to submit :-( Please check.  
Me and some other teams like [@jcole75](https://www.kaggle.com/jcole75) team
are facing the same problem and I think
[@szabo7zoltan](https://www.kaggle.com/szabo7zoltan) also

I think this restriction would affect anyone with more than 40 submissions, of
course. In the meantime one can work on trying to get better results on the
evaluation dataset. Since that is larger (400 tasks) the scores are more
informative.

Hi Ali! Yes, this is an issue and I'm working with the Kaggle team as we speak
to resolve it.

[@asalhi](https://www.kaggle.com/asalhi) thank you for raising this. We've
worked with the Kaggle team and we will be increasing the daily submission
limit from 2x/day to 3x/day. This means that your team w/ 68 submissions so
far will be able to submit again either tomorrow or Thursday, July 4.
There were originally 4 teams that were impacted, this change decreases that
to 2, of which there will be 1 after you're unlocked this week.
We feel this change is a good balance for the 240 teams that have submitted a
working solution and our top teams.
Happy to answer any questions you have, please email us if so,
[team@arcprize.org](mailto:team@arcprize.org)
Thanks for your energy for ARC Prize!

Hey [@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt),
Thank you for the update and for implementing this change! Reducing the daily
submission limit from 5 to 3 is a thoughtful move to encourage more robust and
generalizable solutions. Limiting submissions can indeed help prevent
overfitting and maintain the competition’s integrity by discouraging excessive
test probing.
I appreciate the introduction of the ARC-AGI-Pub leaderboard for more frequent
testing. This seems like a great way to balance iterative model development
with the need for a fair competition environment.
The focus on thoughtful iterations rather than rapid, numerous submissions
aligns well with best practices in machine learning and will likely lead to
more innovative solutions. Thanks for keeping us informed and for your ongoing
support in advancing AI research.
Best of luck to everyone participating!

That's great news!
Smart to analyze (very kaggle) the number of impacted teams from these
changes.
Excited to start working on this over the weekend.

Is there a way to allow failed submissions (no score reported) to not count as
a submission? Maintaining the right format isn't all that easy in this
competition.

Hi Greg and the ARC Prize team,
Thank you for the update on the submission limit. I appreciate the intention
behind this change to maintain competition integrity and encourage thoughtful
iterations. The new ARC-AGI-Pub leaderboard is a great addition for more
frequent testing. Looking forward to continuing this journey and advancing AI
research!
Best of luck to all! 👍🏻

No. I was just saying that this was a positive change that promoted thoughtful
development and kept the competition fair. You are correct to read that
meaning into what I said though. Sorry for the miscommunication. I guess I was
pointing out that this happened 3 months ago. Not my best foot forward. Apols.

Maybe we should just reduce max attempts rather than max daily? Surely then
you can extract the best you can from your model without having to space out
the work over multiple days.

i just wanna test my result is right or not by test probing, and it made my
submission failed and lost one chance. Is this competition not have hidden
evaluation dataset?


### [Greg Kamradt](/gregkamradt)

You should be able to test your result offline without needing to submit by
making sure you have a submissions.json that follows the same format in the
example given in the default datasets.
After you feel comfortable there you can make a proper submission

[@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt) You said
> > we’ve made a secondary leaderboard, ARC-AGI-Pub
Is there a restriction that this leaderboard will require participants to make
their code "public"? Can we claim $2,500 reimbursement without sharing code
publicly?
Is the $150,000 Verification Fund mentioned in that page considered to be part
of the "to be announced later $500,000" prize money of the current
competition?

No, solutions must be public to qualify for verification and reimbursement.

Yes, this is a part of it, we are updating the website with this now

[@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt) First 3 months completed -
is there any update on "To Be Announced Prizes (on ARCprize.org): $500,000"?
Did any one utilise the fund "ARC-AGI-Pub Verification: $150,000"?
