### Can submissions use closed source LLM apis? yes? no? another track?
If I read the rules correctly, the no internet rules imply a prohibition on
the usage of OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini , etc etc. That being said, I do want to
see how far a sota LLM can go by simply prompting the hell out of it. I hope
it's not just me. So how should I, or any explorer, participate in a way
that's fair, open and also able to use any closed source LLM of their choice?
For the record, I tried to dump the problem into GPT4-o , and I'll be honest
the answer is abysmal, so for those who are not looking into this direction,
you're likely right. That being said, I'll be equally excited if anyone can
prompt the hell out of it and dramatically improve the performance (so
_scaling is indeed all you need_) or not able to prompt the hell out of it (so
_the better architecture is on the way_).
I think what I would do, if eventually the answer is no, and I do find some
meaningful results, is I can just publish my prompting repo with my findings;
but if there's another track that allows closed source LLM usage if the whole
code is open sourced, that would be great.

You have the opportunity to check your solution on the main site
<https://arcprize.org/leaderboard>. You just won’t receive a $1M in this
competition and that’s all. (Perhaps the organizers will add some kind of
prize on their website, but so far there is no such prize!)
