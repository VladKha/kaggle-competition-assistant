### Does VLM work for ARC Prize 2024? Why everyone focuses on LLM?
I just joined this competition,  
At first glance, it seems that this kind of question requires strong spatial
understanding, so how about using VLM?  
This is just a random thought, let me hear your thoughts.  
I want to publish Code for this approach if there is a demand.  
I saw some paper say GPT4V does not work well, but I think we can do better
prompt engineering.

The paper says:
The first-place program from the (previous) Kaggle challenge solved 21% of
these hidden tasks, and an ensemble of the first- and second-place programs
**solved 31%**.
The winning programs on Kaggle used **program-synthesis** methods that
searched over combinations of manually defined, primitive grid operations in
order to find combinations that correctly map inputs to outputs in the task
demonstrations. The authors of the winning programs acknowledge that such
methods are not likely to generalize well and ARC remains largely unsolved by
any AI methods.

So, static approach still works better?
