### General Security


## Please help with this question: How do you secure your machine?
The way I used to do it was that I had two laptops. The dirty machine, which
was just whatever (in this particular case Ubuntu 18 running ufw.) The clean
machine I used for years, only to write code and notes. After basic software
needs were met, it was never plugged into a router, the wireless card was
removed, and it only ran on battery power. It was never plugged in to charge
while running. Shut all the way down; plug in to charge the battery; unplug;
turn on and use. I basically had nothing to lose on the dirty box; all my IP
(good, bad or ugly) was on the clean box. Now I need better security for the
working box. I welcome tips. The last time I asked, I was pointed to an
online, British, "Security as a service" company… Didn't seem like a good
risk. And here's why: my perspective has been tainted (bent? damaged?) by
watching a movie titled, "The Good Shephard," a (I'm guessing) fictional
presentation of the beginning of America's security machine, which went into
high gear with the OSS during WWII. It explained how the Americans were a
little green at the cloak and dagger stuff, that the Brits had been perfecting
for centuries. So Britain took young America under its wing. Anyway. Heavy
stuff. Really pushed me away from words like "Let me handle that for you." in
Security situations.

So, other than the downvotes, nothing? No details, no info? Security just an
uncool topic in "The Boring 20's"? My Windows box uses Eset. 64G and it runs
like mud. Am I just doomed to darkness? Bueller? Anyone? Anyone?
