### The field of this competition
May I ask if the field of this competition is deep learning or reinforcement
learning, and does it require high computing resource equipment? Is it
suitable for ordinary people to play?

It's AI. It could be framed as either a deep learning problem, a program
synthesis problem, or a search for novel neurosymbolic architectures. Regular
folks with low compute resources can definitely enter and in fact some of the
top entries in previous editions of the competition did not consume much
compute resources at all.
