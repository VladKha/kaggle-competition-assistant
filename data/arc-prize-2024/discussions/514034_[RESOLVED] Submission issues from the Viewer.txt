### [RESOLVED] Submission issues from the Viewer
**UPDATE:** Submissions are now working from the Notebook Viewer.
We're aware of the [reports](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-
prize-2024/discussion/512256) of users unable to submit from the Viewer, and
are still working on a fix. In the meantime, you'll have to make submissions
while in the notebook Editor (in the right-hand column options).

When you submit, your code is run against a hidden evaluation set, and your
score is calculated automatically from those results.

However long it takes your notebook to run against the hidden test set, and
then a couple of minutes for the actual scoring.
