### An early prize might boost new ideas
Leader board is speaking for itself, however I think in this competition there
should be an early prize for publicizing the totally new approach to the
solution for this problem. The prize should only be awarded if a new idea
contrasting the DPS. This would help in generating new ideas for the process
of solving these efficiently

[@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt) The prizes section says:  
"Additional $500K of prizes to be announced later".
Could you please announce the details if they are already finalised, or are
you open to consider Kagglers suggestions (such as this post).

Yes absolutely! We are learning a ton from this competition. Our #1 goal is to
get ARC-AGI solved. To that end our intention is to use the prize money
(including the additional tba money) as an incentive to drive behavior towards
this.

[@gregkamradt](https://www.kaggle.com/gregkamradt) Perhaps announce prizes for
the first team to reach intermediate thresholds such as 55, 65, 75? (in
addition to the grand prize for 85)
