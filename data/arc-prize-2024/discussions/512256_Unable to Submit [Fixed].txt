You can submit directly while editing the notebook. When you open the notebook
for editing there are options on the right panel. For example: Input, Output,
Save Version… One of the options is "Submit to Competition". This will save
the notebook and also submit it for scoring. I hope this helps

Unfortunately that is not an option, the submit button is grayed out, last
time in a recent competition it was a configuration issue for a few users, not
sure what the case is now, no official answer from Kaggle staff

Heads up, I had to actually go to edit mode, not even just viewing the
notebook. Then the option is under the input and output sections in right
sidebar.

You cannot submit the submission.json file directly after saving the notebook,
but you need to submit the notebook in the notebook editor.
