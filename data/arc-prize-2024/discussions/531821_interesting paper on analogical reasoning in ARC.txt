### interesting paper on analogical reasoning in ARC
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14855>
"This paper demonstrates that model-based reinforcement learning (model-based
RL) is a suitable approach for the task of analogical reasoning. We
hypothesize that model-based RL can solve analogical reasoning tasks more
efficiently through the creation of internal models. To test this, we compared
DreamerV3, a model-based RL method, with Proximal Policy Optimization, a
model-free RL method, on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) tasks"
