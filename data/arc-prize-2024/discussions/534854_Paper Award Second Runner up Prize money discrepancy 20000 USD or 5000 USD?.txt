### Paper Award Second Runner up Prize money discrepancy 20000 USD or 5000
USD?
Hey, there! In the competition's overview page, the prize money for second
runner-up is 20000 USD. On the other hand thou, on the official website, it
says 5000 USD?  
Why is that? I guess, it's a glitch coz the pool prize for Paper Award is
75000 USD.
**Overview Page's Description:**
> Paper Award Prizes: $75,000  
>  Winner: $50,000  
>  First Runner Up: $20,000  
>  Second Runner Up: $20,000

I've corrected the Overview page! The external website and competition rules
were correct. It was a typo on my part - thanks for raising!
