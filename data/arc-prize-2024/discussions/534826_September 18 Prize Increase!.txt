### September 18 Prize Increase!
Hey all,
Exciting news! As the hosts announced
[here](https://x.com/arcprize/status/1836102653740515760), they've allocated
$125k of the committed prize funds to this competition. This includes an
additional $100,000 to the Grand Prize in the event score of 85% is achieved,
and an additional $25,000 added to the Paper Prize, with a third award now
included as well.
I've updated the competition rules and prize pool accordingly. Happy Modeling!
