### Test time augmentation for active inference
For those working on active inference, how are you guys tacking the problem of
data augmentation? The augmentation is the easy part, but how do you ensure
the logic remains conserved when augmenting the input examples? I have been
wondering about this for quite some time but dont really seem to get anything
going here. Seems like the best shot is to keep the 'augmentors' as simple as
possible, and naively augment the test set and fit our models on this noisy
distribution.
