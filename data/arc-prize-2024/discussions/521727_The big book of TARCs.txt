### The big book of TARCs
Dear all of the abstract reasoners out there… 🧙‍♂️
Our treasure of all training and evaluation tarcs has been compiled into a
single magical pdf book [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khahuras/the-
big-book-of-tarcs)! 📙
![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-
attachments/o/inbox%2F1829450%2F6a83bd6b24da0dba003f5756b8a2bb7d%2FScreenshot%202024-07-23%20at%201.20.45%20am.png?generation=1721661654528629&alt=media)
Make your own copy, design an arcful wonderful hardback cover 📔, and put it
under your pillow.
Let it sleep into thee dreams everyday, everynight 💤…. May the Lord of tarcs
be with us all the time until we gain sufficient general intelligence to crack
this millenium riddle together. 💡
Last but not least, please upvote the book dataset to gain some extra lucky
charm in this wonderful journey.🍀
Enjoy.
