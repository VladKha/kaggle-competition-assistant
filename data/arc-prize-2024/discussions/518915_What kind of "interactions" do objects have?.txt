### What kind of "interactions" do objects have?
This question is strictly related to my other question about what objects are
present in the images: [see this
discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-
prize-2024/discussion/518585)
Now my question is: what are the most commonly seen interactions between the
objects?  
I think that we can distinguish at least 2 kinds of interactions: static and
dynamical.  
Static interaction is best seen as a property of a single image.  
Just to name a few:
  * Touching: having at least one adjacent edge or corner
  * Enclosing: obj A is enclosed in obj B
Dynamical interactions usually require seeing an input-output pair to
understand it.  
For example:
  * Superposition: requires the understanding of object persistence
  * Bouncing: best seen with "particle trajectories", for example a line "bouncing" from a solid block
  * "Support": in the presence of falling or similar behavior some objects do not move and "resist" the motion of other objects
Do you think there are other kind of interactions? What categorization do you
suggest? Do you think there exists a set of interactions that is both small
and expressive enough to generalize what is seen in ARC?
