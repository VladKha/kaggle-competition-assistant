### How was the ARC data generated?
Does anyone know how François Chollet created the data? By hand or by code? If
he wrote a code to generate tasks, then is the code available to public?

It was created by hand, that's why contained some mistakes originally. But
actually there is a task generator here: <https://github.com/michaelhodel/re-
arc>
It was linked through the official page: <https://arcprize.org/guide> ->
COMMUNITY -> Repositories
