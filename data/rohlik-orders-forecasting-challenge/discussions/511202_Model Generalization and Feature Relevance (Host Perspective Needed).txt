### Model Generalization and Feature Relevance (Host Perspective Needed)
As some have already mentioned, this competition might be a lottery or end up
like the [Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability
competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-
model-stability) using a hack. I wanted to ask you
[@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) if you (and your team) have thought
about the possible generalization of the resulting models at the end of the
competition. There are valid concerns that, at the end of the day, the best
score might come from just the prior days of the predicted time period, with
the other time ranges not even considered. This sounds like heavy overfitting
and not very helpful for building a generalized model. It might be that a good
model (no overfitting; validation, test, and training error well aligned) is
taking the short run.
That would help me and probably others decide whether to join this competition
(as I haven't yet), but I want to make sure I don't need to use hacks instead
of building "the best" model.
Another concern from my side is that I don't see many related features that
can actually link to your "order" column. For instance, the date, public
holidays, and almost all other features don't provide information if you have
1 million or 10K orders/customers. I mean, of course, if there is a public
holiday, some people shop more online, but it's only about what they do and
does not relate to the prediction of orders itself. This means that the orders
from 1 year ago (with a different user base) will tell literally nothing about
the orders in 2 years (as there is no linkage in that data). Wouldn't it make
sense to have correlated data to make an empirical statement? For instance:
  * Amount of registered users
  * Rate of users that actually order
  * The type of user (weekly grocery buyer or one-timer)
  * …
I fear that massive over-fitting might be the "best" result in terms of score
but actually for your business case, it's not usable at all (missing
generalization and reliability)
I hope you get my thoughts, thanks for your answer in advance!

Hi [@etiennekaiser](https://www.kaggle.com/etiennekaiser),
Good points. Thank you for raising them and I appreciate the opportunity to
address them.
As stated in the competition rules, we will be double-checking the winning
solutions to make sure they are not just a 'hack' to overfit to leaderboard.
We do hope the submissions are done in good faith and trying to develop the
best model as you say. We are aware of the fact that there is limited data
available for testing and will be careful to analyse the wining solutions. You
are correct in saying that the recent data is very important. There are also
public holidays and periods in the test set that require insight from
historical data and without using them it will be tricky to get a very good
result. The competition to large extend reflects our forecasting process where
we estimate the next few months and then move forward. If you have any
specific ideas to address this concern, please let me know. Happy to consider
them and discuss further.
Re the features, we have included user activity on the platform (2 different
features in the dataset) that are in the training set. We can't be more
specific about what they mean but they in essence represent volume of
interaction of users on the platform and their shopping behaviour. I hope
these help. These can't be provided for the test set - they are leaky. So at
the time of the prediction, we don't know how users will be interacting so
can't use it for prediction.
Happy to continue the discussion and thanks again for the comments.

Good morning [@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera),
Thank you for your detailed response!  
I appreciate the assurance that winning solutions will be checked to prevent
over-fitting to the leader board. Regarding the recent data and the role of
public holidays, I agree that using external (historical) datasets may help in
identifying patterns that are not directly visible in the provided data.
I will discuss further ideas on the fly, this competition might also serve as
base for a follow up, after you tested the final models in your production
(Home Credit was also an example of that). Overall this is an interesting
competition as you can go really into detail with relatively less
features/dimensions, count me in.

I found you have also participated in Home Credit, and I agree with your
opinion
