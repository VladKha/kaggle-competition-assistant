### A Question regarding the 2 train sets
This might be a stupid question but what is exactly the difference between the
2 datasets, are there the same dates but the calendar one gives more info on
the holidays or do i have to merge the 2?

The `train_calendar` file contains holiday information for various warehouses.
Some of these warehouses may not appear in the `train` dataset due to having
zero orders on those particular days. There are two categories of holidays to
consider: those on days when orders are recorded and those on days with no
orders.
I have combined these two datasets into a unified dataset, which you can
review in my [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/akinduhiman/data-
visualization-in-cleaned-and-ensembled-data).

[@vanmarcos](https://www.kaggle.com/vanmarcos) The calendar dataset is
literally a calendar with all the dates across the historical dataset. The
dates that are not in the training dataset are found in the calendar. [See the
introduction part of my notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yantxx/rohlik-

Hello Yan, i see thank you for providing the notebook.

I think the best solution ,that you have to make an intersection between them
or make Rolling technique and and add new features to the test set
