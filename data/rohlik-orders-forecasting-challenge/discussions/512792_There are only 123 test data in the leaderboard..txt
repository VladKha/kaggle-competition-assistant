### There are only 123 test data in the leaderboard.
In fact, everyone is going further and further on the path of overfitting.

For this competition, we should probably not care about the public LB.


### [Ravi Ramakrishnan](/ravi20076)
Agreed, also complex workflows and models are unlikely to work here
[@yantxx](https://www.kaggle.com/yantxx)  
I think we can expect a high shakeup at the end!


### [Yuchen20](/yuchen2066)
But I thought from another post, the competition host have verified that the
LB and private test are not divided
[sequentially](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rohlik-orders-forecasting-
challenge/discussion/510914), wouldn't that make the LB and private test
really similar? and therefore would be better to 'overfit' public LB.


### [Yan Teixeira](/yantxx)
[@yuchen2066](https://www.kaggle.com/yuchen2066) I think the host made a good
decision by not using a sequential split for the data. This makes it harder to
probe the leaderboard and gain an unfair advantage.
> wouldn't that make the LB and private test really similar?
Since we don't know how the split was made, it's currently impossible to know
the distribution of the target in the public and private sets. We don't know
if they are similar or not. Sure you can bet that they will be similar, it's a
valid strategy.

Not that I condone this, but one could still probe the leaderboard to check if
there is any imbalance between the included warehouses. Imagine, for example,
finding out munich wasn't included in the public set at all.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


### [Yuchen20](/yuchen2066)
oh yes, this could be very plausible


### [MichalKecera](/mkecera)
Hi [@lennarthaupts](https://www.kaggle.com/lennarthaupts) there is not that
large imbalance. Every warehouse is included in the test. The split is fairly
random.


### [Thomas Mei√üner](/thomasmeiner)
Personally I like this type of competition. This high level of uncertainty
requires careful testing and evaluation.  
A shakeup is very likely here. So far I have more question marks than answers,
but it keeps the excitement.


### [Adam Logman](/adamlogman)
In addition there is no huge gaps between competitors


### [Yan Teixeira](/yantxx)
Please throw your questions on the forum. I want to discuss ü§£
it has been too quiet so far


### [Adam Logman](/adamlogman)
You have to wait for a huge shake up  
so trust your cv , don‚Äôt care about Lb


### [Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah](/abdmental01)
Half of the LB : Uses KFold and i think In Private Score There Will be a Big
Change..
