### We can know the holiday information in advance
For example, the New Year falls on January 1st every year and Christmas falls
on December 25th every year. We can know the holiday information in advance,
which means that we can also use this known future information during model
inference.
Let me give an example, for example, tomorrow is a holiday, and people will
buy a lot of things to celebrate the holiday. Today's 'orders' will increase,
and we already know what holiday tomorrow is. We can add the information that
tomorrow is a holiday to our feature engineering to predict today's 'orders'.

test_calendar already has the holidays we should use. Have you found any
holidays that are not there?

[@yunsuxiaozi](https://www.kaggle.com/yunsuxiaozi) yes, that is a good
approach. Also, calendar events is the one dataset that you could augment
externally without risk of leakage. (i.e. any holidays that we might have
missed)
