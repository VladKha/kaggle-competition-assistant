### iTransformer
This is a model I saw during a recent competition, and it is a model from the
latest paper by Tsinghua University.It is said that it can achieve state-of-
the-art on many datasets.

arxiv:<https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06625>
I tried using this model in the Kaggle beginner competition and achieved a
relatively good result:

Thanks for sharing, I would be curious to see if such models can be effective
in this context. I'm afraid that the small training set might be slightly too
limited for such complex models, but I would be gladly proven wrong :)
