### 21st Place Solution
Firstly thank you kaggle and Rohilk for this competition, it was a great
opportunity to learn a lot about time series analysis and forecasting,and
congrats for all winners.
I used many features and ideas shared in discussions and code sections,so
thank you for all those who made their work public,the features i added :
1-week before holiday.  
2-week before and after shops closed.  
3-mean_user_activity_2/mean_mov_change.
I used the last two months for validation,and i also replaced the orders in
2020 with the average of orders in 2022.
Models and Ensemble:
1-LGBM(objective = 'tweedie',boosting_type = 'gbdt', num_leaves =
131,learning_rate=0.17,n_estimators = 60,  
max_depth=-1,  
min_data_in_leaf=20,  
bagging_fraction=0.77,  
feature_fraction=0.9)  
2-CatBoostRegressor() 3-HistGradientBoostingRegressor(max_iter = 116)  
With weights  
LGBM : 0.58  
Catboost : 0.30  
HistGradientBoosting : 0.12

Congrats!
Do you know how much replacing the orders in 2020 with the avg of orders 2022
helped? Wonder if doing someting like w1 * orders for date in 2020 + w2 *
orders for date in 2022 where w1+w2 ~ 1 might work?

Thank you  
Using the average of 2022 improved my Private score from 0.0445 to 0.0437.  
but i didn't try the approach you mentioned,also using average of other years
dropped the score.
