### Incorporating Pre- and Post-Holiday Effects in Model Training
Hi everyone,
I've been thinking about the potential impact of holidays on consumer
behavior, particularly how the days leading up to and following holidays might
influence order patterns. To capture this, I'm considering adding features
that indicate the number of days before and after a holiday.
**Here's what I'm planning** :  
Feature Creation: Add a new column that counts the number of days before and
after holidays. This could help the model recognize patterns such as increased
shopping before a holiday or decreased activity afterward.
Categorical Features: I also add binary indicators for is_holiday,
before_holiday, and after_holiday to see if the model benefits from this
simpler representation.
**Why This Matters** :  
Holiday effects can introduce significant variability in order volumes.
Capturing these nuances improve the model's ability to predict spikes or drops
around these periods, leading to better overall accuracy.
What other features might work well in capturing the pattern?

That is a great observation.  
I looked up the days when order >= 5000 and found that there are indeed as
many orders before and after holidays as there are on holidays.  
I also heard that Fridays account for a large percentage of orders, so I
checked and found twice as many orders as before and after holidays. These
could be the amount of features that could significantly change the
performance of the model.
