### Missing Dates
I found that there are 173 unique dates that are missing on at least one of
the warehouse series. What does that mean? 0 orders on those dates for that
warehouse?

Hi [@gunesevitan](https://www.kaggle.com/gunesevitan),
Thank you for the question. If the dates are missing then the warehouse was
not open. This happens mostly on public holidays and mostly should be in
German warehouses.
I hope this answers the question.
Kind regards,  
Michal

Thanks for the reply [@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera). For example
2024-03-10 doesn't exist for both Frankfurt_1 and Munich_1, but that date
doesn't exist in train calendar either. Warehouses can be closed on any date
and it doesn't necessarily have to be holiday, right?

Hi [@gunesevitan](https://www.kaggle.com/gunesevitan),  
2024-03-10 is Sunday and the warehouses are closed on Sundays in Germany. So
yes, it's not only holidays but also Sundays in Germany. In Prague, Sundays
are open so it depends on the country.

### [ikram ullah](/ikram98ai)
what if we use synthetic data?


### [Itachi Uchiha](/blade007)
Hey, Would it make sense if we impute 0 in target variable for missing dates
and introduce a new feature for warehouse closed or not ? I've observed dates
are missing in test set as well so was thinking about it, will update if I
find any difference post implementing.

Hi Evitan,  
Have you written FALSE on your title? That happened to the topic that I wrote
just now.  
If you wrote False, disconsider this comment.  
Best regards,  
Marília

Nope it seems like a bug


### [Samvel Kocharyan](/samvelkoch)
