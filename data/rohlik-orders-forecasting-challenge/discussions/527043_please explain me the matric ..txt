**Why a lower score is a better submission?**
If your fourecasts Ft are closer to the actual values At, the difference |At
-Ft| will be smaller. Consequently, the relative error |At - Ft|/At will also
be smaller. When yo average these smaller errors, the overall MAPE value will
be lower, indicating more accurate predictions.
**Why in 0.x like?**
This is just a matter of how the sistem displays the score. In this case it is
not multiplied by 100.
