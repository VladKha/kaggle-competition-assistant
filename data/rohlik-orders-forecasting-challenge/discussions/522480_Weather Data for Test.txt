### Weather Data for Test
I made the small effort and created a data set with the necessary weather data
for the locations Brno, Prague, Munich, Frankfurt and Budapest.
You are welcome to use this data for your analyses. I look forward to seeing
whether these features make an important contribution to the performance of
the models.
**To avoid being disqualified, please do not use the data until the
competition has officially ended or do not make any submissions with it.
According to the officials, external data is not allowed.**
You can get the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/rohlik-
order-forecast-weather-data-for-test).
Happy coding!

Thanks for picking that by hand, that must be cumbersome!  
I just ask myself if this does not fall into the restriction to use external
data, as [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) is used and also handle the
missing weather data in the **test** set.
I just recall the 2 answers based on the competition rules made by the
competition host [@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) in a [very early
post](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rohlik-orders-forecasting-
challenge/discussion/511341#2864839).

I personally avoid to use any external data at all, to prevent being
disqualified for using leaky data. It's just my personal perspective - happy
for any thoughts to get that aligned!

Thank you so much for your hint. I didnt read the full guidelines for that
competition.  
So the safest option is to use only the data when you are not planing to make
ansubmission for that. I wil probably add some disclaimer to the dataset.


### [Etienne Kaiser (郑翊天）](/etiennekaiser)
You are welcome! Yes I trust that it will be a clear cut without exceptions to
use only the competition data. Most fair in my opinion. After the competition
or as you said for those who not plan to submit, your dataset is for sure
useful.
