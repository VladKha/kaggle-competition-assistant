### get complete competition data
Due to the fact that the evaluation metric for the competition is MAPE,
y_true=0 cannot appear in the data. If it does, a denominator of 0 will cause
the metric to report an error. Adding a 1e-15 to the denominator can avoid
errors, but it can lead to a huge loss in the evaluation metric.
I think this is the reason for some missing dates in the training data. Do we
need this data to train the model? I am also searching for the answer.
I tried to recover complete training data.This is the first version I wrote,
and if necessary, it may continue to be updated.

[@yunsuxiaozi](https://www.kaggle.com/yunsuxiaozi) you can use RMSE to
evaluate your model during testing. It is not sensitive to null values, and
the formula is straightforward, But is it a good idea to use a different
metric than the one used for scoring? I'm not sure about that.
