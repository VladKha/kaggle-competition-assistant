### Comparison of Random Forest, XGBoost, and ARIMA (Time Series)
I created three models for prediction, and here is what I found:
I built three models for the training data and calculated the MAPE for each
warehouse!
I was thinking about trying dynamic model selection because I see some trends
in some warehouses but not in others. However, it turns out that the random
forest predicts the best among the three models for every warehouse! (I used
different libraries, but I tried my best to set up exactly the same
configuration for each model.)

I've got to find a better way to predict!

I tried smoothening the data by moving average still for Munich I am unable to
get good accuracy


### [yokoshu25](/shusei)
Yeah, I agree. Since the Munich warehouse is newer compared to other
warehouses and it has a dramatic trend, it’s one of the hardest to predict.
There are a lot of sharp peaks, and it's following a similar path to Prague 2
and 3. The test period may be similar to those two warehouses!

### [Ravi Ramakrishnan](/ravi20076)
Totally agreed!  
Small dataset + newer warehouse in Munich make it difficult to predict.  
I think we have a high chance of shakeup here, so trusting the CV score is
important [@shusei](https://www.kaggle.com/shusei)


### [LH](/leonhardhochfilzer)
I agree that the potential for a shake-up is quite big, however I also have a
hard time purely trusting my CV because being able to forecast Munich
especially on the dataset well might not necessarily be a good indicator of
performance in the hidden set. (Also I am clearly biased and would hope that
the shake-up is not too bad haha).

[@ravi20076](https://www.kaggle.com/ravi20076)  
Thank you for your comment! Yes, the potential shakeup makes the prediction
hard.  
I’ll trust the CV score! Thanks for the advice!


### [yokoshu25](/shusei)
[@leonhardhochfilzer](https://www.kaggle.com/leonhardhochfilzer)  
Yeah, predicting a shake-up is pretty hard. We can go onto the company's site,
check their balance sheet, and see how much they've invested compared to other
warehouses, and then make a guess. But I think that violates the rules haha.
