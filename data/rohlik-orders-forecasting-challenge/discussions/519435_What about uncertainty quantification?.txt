### What about uncertainty quantification?
Hi,
I am wondering if an eval metric around uncertainty quantification (like CRPS)
would have had more business value?
Especially in demand forecasting uncertainty quantification could help a lot
to to reduce the risk of following the recommendation of a model that is
unreliable. And even if it is unreliable, you have much more transparency.
What do you think?

Uncertainty metrics ought to always be included.

Such a good Idea,but we will face many problems because of our tiny dataset
and we will not be sure if the outcome of the metric is exact the same . but
we have to try it.

Absolutely makes sense Thomas! 100% right

Makes sense! Often in real projects, decision-makers want to know about
uncertainty. [@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) , was this something
that was considered?
