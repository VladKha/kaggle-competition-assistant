### Test and Trian Date Issue
When you look at the test dates, you'll see that they ran from 16 March 2024
to 15 May (last month), and that data was regularly collected every 4 days.
However, there is a significant difference in the train; the data was
collected from 2020 to 14 May 2024. You will need to account for these in your
calculations, along with any conflicts, COVID-19 outbreaks, and other crises
that have occurred since 2020.
you have to trust your cv , do not try to be smart ,  
best way to prevent overfitting, train your data from 2023 or 2024 to avoid
overfitting

Hm, although the covid one is a great reminder, but will it be helpful in the
testing data?

From the overview:
> Our challenge focuses on predicting the number of orders (grocery
> deliveries) at selected warehouses for the next 60 days.
Covid outbreak consideration is a nice catch, thanks!

Hi [@adamlogman](https://www.kaggle.com/adamlogman), interesting point.
However, I wouldn't train just from 2023 to 2024. The reason for that is that
there is also the possibility that the final test set is not only a long
sequence of several months. I could also imagine that it might be one month in
Winter 2021, then a month in Summer 2023, etc. If you only collect more likely
linear data that behaves in an ordinary way, then you might fail in every
special case.


### [Adam Logman](/adamlogman)
We should focus on this season of the last two years or just the past year
because the final test set prediction date may fall within this month and
following months.


### [Etienne Kaiser (郑翊天）](/etiennekaiser)
Yes, I didn't recall to read the 60 days as
[@jaejohn](https://www.kaggle.com/jaejohn) said, with that information it
makes sense. I'm going even further that I guess the private test set ranges
from mid of May to mid of July (1 months buffer for host eventually). I don't
know if the private test set has to be already be in place from the start or
can be evaluated with the submitted versions later on? (as the new data is not
existing). This is pure speculation!
