### any advice for the features which is not in the test set?
there are some features in the training set, and not in the test set. like
shut down ,percipitation .etc. I just drop these features for now, is there a
way we can use these features to make a prediction

Hi [@fanbao0819](https://www.kaggle.com/fanbao0819),
I looked into the features you mentioned, specifically those related to
shutdowns and limitations (i.e., `shutdown`, `mini_shutdown`, `blackout`,
`frankfurt_shutdown`, `warehouse_limited`). After examining how often these
events occur, I found that they are quite rare, and the order volumes on these
days appear to be relatively normal. Below are the counts of such days in the
training set by warehouse:
  * Brno_1: 3 days
  * Budapest_1: 1 day
  * Frankfurt_1: 4 days
  * Munich_1: 1 day
  * Prague_1: 2 days
  * Prague_2: 2 days
  * Prague_3: 2 days
Regarding the `mov_change` column, it primarily tags the date range from
October 2022 to July 2023 across all warehouses. For Budapest, there is an
additional variation within this range (with a value of 0.7). However, the
significance of this feature is not entirely clear to me. You can find a more
detailed visualization in my
[Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tomkrger/rohlik-forecasting-regression-
feature-study#Orders-and-Features-by-warehouse).
As for user activity features, I attempted to predict them following an in-
depth analysis of data preprocessing techniques, similar to what I did for
orders in my [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tomkrger/rohlik-
forecasting-regression-feature-study#Hypothesis-Testing). While the prediction
for `user_activity_1` was reasonable, I faced significant challenges in
predicting `user_activity_2`. Using these predictions to forecast orders
proved problematic. Due to the strong correlation between orders and user
activity (especially `user_activity_2`), these features have high importance
in the models. However, the prediction errors for user activity in the test
set are too substantial, leading to poor performance in the final orders
prediction.
I hope this helps clarify how these features might be used and the challenges
associated with them.

you can use weekly/monthly averages, but I would probably just leave them out
because you would need data for longer periods from external source which is
not allowed in this competition.
