Hi [@ucas0v0zhuoqunli](https://www.kaggle.com/ucas0v0zhuoqunli), 0.7 means
there was a small minimum order value change. 1 means there was a larger
change.

Hi [@tanakasandesuka](https://www.kaggle.com/tanakasandesuka) ,
Thanks for the questions. Re user activity I canâ€™t be more specific
unfortunately as we canâ€™t disclose exactly what these mean. I can say that
they are different way if measuring user activity on the platform but they
will be correlated. Shutdowns are pretty much the same but mini shutdown means
that only a part if warehouse was affected or just for few hours. Shutdown is
more severe.
I hope this helps.
