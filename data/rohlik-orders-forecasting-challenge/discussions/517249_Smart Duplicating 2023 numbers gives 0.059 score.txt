### Smart Duplicating 2023 numbers gives 0.059 score
In the notebook [https://www.kaggle.com/code/anmolgarg1998/rohlik-order-
analysis](url) ,  
-> I just joined test date orders with train orders of same Day of Year of 2023. Joining occurs in a way that Day of week is similar and also Black Friday is joined with Black Friday.  
-> After duplicating 2023 orders, I accounted yearly increase in orders by calculating delta for each warehouse respectively 
This mere Data trick is giving 0.059 score .  
Reasoning :: We can't use any data that can predict day variation in daily
orders like weather or even past day orders etc. We are left with only
weekends,holiday which will be mostly similar yearly. Only variation in both
years is of any holiday that occurs on X day of week in year 2023 but on Y day
for 2024 but even Tree based model won't capture that variance because we
don't have any train data to capture that.
Making this notebook public as it gives more clarity of Test data and one can
also incorporate some techniques while training models of their own.
