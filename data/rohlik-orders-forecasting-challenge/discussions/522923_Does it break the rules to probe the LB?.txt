### Does it break the rules to probe the LB?
The organizers have mentioned that they will check winning submissions for
violations of the rules. I understand that external data is disallowed, but
could the organizers clarify to what extent it's okay to probe the LB?
To give an example, I've seen this code in a public notebook:
![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-
attachments/o/inbox%2F311485%2F25033ea3bfb46eff8e58593867950d93%2FScreenshot%202024-07-29%20at%2007.55.22.png?generation=1722232682598435&alt=media)
These are overall factors that multiply the predictions of the model. Although
these numbers could come from an honest study using only train data, they
could also be obtained by probing the public LB. Is this allowed?
To clarify my point, although public and private LB are based on a different
subset of the data, it is likely there is leakage from one to the other:
  * If the public/private split is random, for each warehouse you can estimate the average number of orders during the test set by probing the LB.
  * If the split is a temporal one, one can still extract useful information. For instance, if public LB contains the first 3 weeks of data, you can extract the average orders during these 3 weeks, which is "future" information from the point of view of the competition.
In both cases, this info can be used to calibrate the models as in the picture
above.
To summarize, is it okay to probe the LB and use the results to calibrate the
overall volume of orders in our models? If this is disallowed, how will this
be checked?

Hi [@aleixgim](https://www.kaggle.com/aleixgim),
Good point. Thanks.
The goal of the competition is to have an automated system that is also
leakage free. So if there is some automated way that these factors were
created with and it does not use any data from future, then we would allow it.
If these factors are obtained by probing the LB then this is not replicable in
real world and the solution uses future data from test set which is not
allowed. There is clear leakage.
Hope this clarifies it.
Michal.

Hi [@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) ,  
Is it allowed if I use prediction as training data? Predict 60 days to to
long, so I am thinking of using autoregression(like in LLM), basically i will
predict a next day for each warehouse and use the predicted day for re-
training, then keep repeating till end of data.


### [Arnold Kakas](/arnoldkakas)
I don't see a reason why this would not be allowed, it is a standard recursive
approach to use a forecasted values as a predictor


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
thanks for confirming. If it is allowed, I would try it.


### [MichalKecera](/mkecera)
Yes, that's ok.


### [Aleix Gimenez](/aleixgim)
Hi [@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera), thanks for confirming this
behavior is not allowed. I have no interest in using "future" data, but I
wanted to make sure others won't use it either :)
That's why I asked the second part of the question, namely, how will you check
for wrong behavior? For example, how can you know whether training
hyperparameters are determined by probing or not?


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
[@aleixgim](https://www.kaggle.com/aleixgim), we can check it by finding fixed
parameters in a notebook, something like above. I think checking it is simple,
he only needs to check 3 prize notebooks.


### [MichalKecera](/mkecera)

We will be confirming if the algorithms/models/notebooks we get to claim the
prize don't violate the rules. It would be difficult to hide this.


### [BOOBA](/youneseloiarm)
Hi [@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera),
Could I ask about the current record of the MAPE metric with this dataset, at
least for a 1-month unseen dataset your team has worked on offline (real
world)?
We observed that in the public leaderboard, the top 10 have MAPE < 0.035. We
are unsure if this is due to leaking on the public leaderboard or the use of
an exceptionally robust model. We understand that we are dealing with a
forecasting problem with few features in the dataset. Please let us know your
team's current record for the unseen dataset (at least 1 month). This will
help us determine if we can break that record and if this competition could
potentially break your team's record.
Thank you.

Haha, I feel like you're talking about me. I don't know the attitude of the
organizers of the competition, and I'm not currently at the forefront of the
competition. My methods can indeed improve my scores to a certain extent. I
hope to learn from the front row solution after the competition.


### [Aleix Gimenez](/aleixgim)
I mentioned your code as an example haha I'm quite sure LB probing should help
in this competition, so I wanted to understand how the organizers are planning
to address it. I'd prefer not to use LB probing, but I'd feel stupid if
everyone else is doing it except for me.
