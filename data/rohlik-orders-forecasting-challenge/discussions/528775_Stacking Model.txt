### Stacking Model
Why does everyone use logistic regression in stacking code?
Logistic regression is a classification problem, what we are trying to solve
is a regression problem. Below are the MAPE values in the stacking training
model loop:

I examined the importance of each regression model after ensemble. As shown
below, the importance for the logistic regression data was much smaller than
the others, about 4.5%. What this result means depends on the model, but it
does not seem to make much of a difference.
