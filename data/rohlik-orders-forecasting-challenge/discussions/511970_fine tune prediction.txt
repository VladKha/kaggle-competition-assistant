### fine tune prediction
It can be clearly observed from the graph that the 'orders' of each warehouse
has a trend of increasing over time.Perhaps the population has increased?  
So we can fine tune the prediction results.
Firstly, we can multiply the predicted results by a weight greater than 1,
where each warehouse can be operated separately for better results. In the
figure, there is a warehouse that has increased from 1000 to 2000, one
warehouse that has increased from 1000 to 6000, and the rest of the warehouses
have an increase of around 2000. The specific weights can be set
independently, but the size relationship still depends on the increase in
'orders'.
Secondly, due to the overall upward trend of 'orders', the predicted results
of' orders' can be fine tuned, requiring it to not be lower than the minimum
value of 'orders' in the past year.

Just a simple business growth is the most obvious explanation of the orders
increasing trends. Topic research supports this ideas strongly. Models which
we'll create here will struggle from the data drift very soon. Especially for
German market. I guess [@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) and his team
knows that fact. I assume that Rohlik as many other new businesses which
growth started or overlapped Covid and post Covid years suffers more than
usual from some uncertainty in predictive models. Conformal predictions could
be a solution.

Is it supposed to have figures here?

Thank you for the insight.
