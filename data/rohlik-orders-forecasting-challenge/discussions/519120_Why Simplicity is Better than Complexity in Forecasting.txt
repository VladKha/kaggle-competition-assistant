### Why Simplicity is Better than Complexity in Forecasting
What do you think ?!

It's just a matter of how much data you have and how complex it is.


### [Adam Logman](/adamlogman)
[@yantxx](https://www.kaggle.com/yantxx) for this competition , we have small
dataset so that is why I think simplicity is good option


### [Thomas Meißner](/thomasmeiner)
I think it depends.
When complexity gives better performance, complexity is better.  
When simplicity gives almost same performance, then simplicity can still be
better.  
When explainability has high importance, simplicity is better.


### [Arnold Kakas](/arnoldkakas)
well said, this really depends on the goals you want to achieve.  
I can imagine that in monthly forecast you can have more simplicity in order
to improve explainability to identify the strategic points you need to focus
on. However if your forecast is for e.g. S&OP, you would probably go with more
complex model to increase the accuracy in short term prediction.


### [Etienne Kaiser (郑翊天）](/etiennekaiser)
That's a very interesting question also if you think beyond this scope. I
mainly think that the nature of forecasting comes from knowing the known
patterns from the unknown. I don't want to answer this technically, but more
in a philosophical way. The unknown set, thought of as a mass of possible
events, is much larger than the data you have that represents the occurred
events. So, you are given a very small subset of the possible complex
superset. Thus, the main problem, especially in forecasting, is
generalization. You want to be as flexible as possible to even perform well on
unseen events that you didn't train explicitly. What I first thought of was
the [Occam’s Razor Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)
> The simplest explanation is usually the best one.
In forecasting, this principle implies that a model should be no more complex
than necessary to capture the essential nuances or patterns of the data
without being too narrowed down (overfitting).


### [Adam Logman](/adamlogman)
exactly [@etiennekaiser](https://www.kaggle.com/etiennekaiser) , that is why I
think best way to avoid overfitting in forecasting competitions  
. to use simple model or we can say always simple models are win .


### [Josh Haber](/joshhaber)
Simple enough to avoid overfitting, complex enough to capture the patterns of
the data.
