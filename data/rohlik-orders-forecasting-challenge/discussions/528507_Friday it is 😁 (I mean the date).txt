Blessed Friday Everyone.  
in early discussions [@yantxx](https://www.kaggle.com/yantxx) mentioned that
Friday orders were always high alongside with other who agreed and confirmed
that it is always high in all warehouses. I wanted to highlight this
discussion again after it was forgotten due to the linearity of discussions
[discussion link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rohlik-orders-
forecasting-challenge/discussion/511935)
After engineering a feature to mark Friday, checking the top values in orders  
`train[train['orders'] >10000.]`  
and guess what! (as expected)
