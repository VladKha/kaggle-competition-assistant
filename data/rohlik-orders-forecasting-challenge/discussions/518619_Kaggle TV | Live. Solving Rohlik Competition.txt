I'll continue to work with Rohlik Data. Roadmap for today:
  * get hands on tsururu framework, 
  * some feature engineering, 
  * AutoGluon

What was the result from this steam? Did H20 perform well?


### [Samvel Kocharyan](/samvelkoch)
0.0454 from the very basic settings. But I didn't dive too deep beyond
defaults.
[@thomasmeiner](https://www.kaggle.com/thomasmeiner) probably this competition
already has its top possible scores in private LB. I'm not sure that we'll
invent here a new magic wheel for sales prediction. Floating events as
anomalies, user_activities and tricks with data drifts are the keys for a good
models.
[@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) if that not a secret why you need 2
month predictions? I assumed that Rohlik business implies more agile
approaches to the replenishment of warehouse stocks

[@samvelkoch](https://www.kaggle.com/samvelkoch) good question. Thanks.  
We actually need more than 2 months. There are several processes where order
forecast is used:
  * SKU forecast: yes, here you don't need that much in advance as ordering is done more frequently but still need at least a few weeks
  * workforce planning: you need to have a short-term and long-term idea about how many people will be needed at the warehouses and in the logistics. Long-term is easily a couple months in advance.


### [Samvel Kocharyan](/samvelkoch)
That makes sense. Thanks for clarifying, Michal üôè
