### Understanding train and test calendar files
Good evening,
I joined the competition today, and while looking at the data, I wonder what
the purpose of the `test_calendar` file is. If you deduct the rows that are
exactly the same as those in the `test` file, then I don't see its value
except for knowing when a holiday occurred additionally.
This leads me to my second question, which is even more important to me. As
there are only 33 rows out of 13K rows marked with the value `1` in the
`warehouse_limited` column of the `train_calendar` dataset, what does the
additional data mean? Also, if you deduct the rows that are the same between
`train` and `train_calendar`, you are left with almost all `warehouse_limited`
values as `0`. Does it mean that the additional data is really either special
events or Sundays that lead to order values being `NaN` because there were no
`orders`? Or was it just not recorded?
My current understanding is, that all values additionally from the
`train_calendar` file distinct to `train`, is data that indicates a
"shutdown".
If someone can let me know how to nterpret this data, that would be awesome!
:)

The `train_calendar` file includes holiday information for certain warehouses,
some of which are not present in the `train` file due to zero orders on those
days. There are two types of holidays: those where orders are present and
those where orders are not.  
This is what I understood.
I have merged these two datasets into a single dataset. You can view it in my
