### 2nd place solution - single LGBM Model
Thanks to [@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) for hosting this
interesting ML contest. I learned a lot and had a great time with it. Also,
thanks to [@techniquetwice](https://www.kaggle.com/techniquetwice) for
competing with me.
Before approaching the methods I implemented, I need to note a few points:
  * First, our 1st score results on the public leaderboard did not work well on the private leaderboard, my model overfitted with the public lb.
  * Our method presented here is the best version before we changed the parameters that caused overfitting.
  * We optimized the hyperparameters through optuna methods.
  * We trained on a portion of the provided data and used the rest for evaluation.  
My best private score was 0.0366, public score was 0.0292. However, the 1st
code with a public score of 0.0258 had a private score of 0.0445. Now I submit
the best version of the exam with a private score of 0.0366.

single-lgbm).

### What works for me:
  * Add some holidays that are not in the calendar file.
  * Some holidays will use different weights instead of 1 for all holidays (I choose 1.3).
  * Use a single LGBM.
  * Training model with log features (key to avoid shakeup).
  * Use MAE as a loss function instead of MAPE (key to avoid shakeup).
  * Use optuna for hyperparameter finetuning.

### Some experiences of my team:
  * Not all holidays are equally important.
  * MAPE gives a better CV, but MAE is more stable.
  * Still do not evaluate the importance of all the holidays.
#### References, discussions I read before deciding to use MAE instead of MAPE
for the loss function:
  * [Best way to optimize MAPE](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/213897/best-way-to-optimize-mape)
  * [How to optimize MAPE in regression algorithms](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/417588/how-to-optimize-mape-in-regression-algorithms)
  * [What are the shortcomings of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/299712/what-are-the-shortcomings-of-the-mean-absolute-percentage-error-mape?noredirect=1&lq=1)

I hope you guys have a great time, too. If you find anything wrong with my
thinking, feel free to comment.

Thank you for sharing. And congratulations on your ranking. I have a few
questions about your solution.
  1. What is your parameter search method with Optuna for your model? Because you're using a single model. How did you select the test set for Optuna, and did you use cross-validation?
  2. If you used it, what was your CV strategy?


### [techniquetwice](/techniquetwice)
Hi [@alpayabbaszade](https://www.kaggle.com/alpayabbaszade) ,  
I use TimeSeriesSplit for finetuning optuna, for detail:
  * Stage 1: use data from 2020 to 02/2022 to predict month 3,4,5/2022
  * Stage 2: use data from 2020 to 02/2023 to predict month 3,4,5/2023
  * Stage 3: use all train data to predict test data, concat it to train data and re-predict test data
  * I don't predict month 3,4,5 of 2021 because data in 2020 not enough.
  * Loss function is MAE, optimize minimum for MAPE.

KFold works pretty well for me too, I guess the time correlation between days
is not very strong(except holidays) so we can consider this as discrete data.
I will update optuna code when my server got fix.


### [Alpay Abbaszade](/alpayabbaszade)
Hi [@techniquetwice](https://www.kaggle.com/techniquetwice). Thank you so much
for the detailed explanation!


### [Kh치nh Tr故븙](/neetnetnet)
Congratulations, but I'm a bit confused about stage 3. When you use all the
test data combined with the train data, wouldn't that cause data leakage?
Could you explain this in more detail?


### [techniquetwice](/techniquetwice)
Hi [@neetnetnet](https://www.kaggle.com/neetnetnet) ,
Thank for your question. That's not data leakage. While this may seem like
it's a data leak, the model is actually based on past data and its own
predictions. The model has no exposure to future ground truths (ground truth
of lb test data - we don't have it here) during training.
I'm trying to make the model better adapted to the simulated distribution of
the lb test data (the model's predictions will be a distribution that closely
resembles the actual distribution) by combine predicted data to train data.
An example of data leakage is GroupKFold, where the model gets access to
future ground truths when we randomly split and shuffle the data. But it works
quite well in this case, as I explained in the comment above.
Feel free if you have any question.


### [Kh치nh Tr故븙](/neetnetnet)
Thanks for the explaination!!


### [JonasGoe](/jonasgoe)
Really a nice solution! Congrats on the 2nd place!
I really like how you dealt with the logarithm + MAE (and thanks for sharing
the references/sources).
  * We tried using the logarithm only, but that was not successfull in our case.  
-> Seems like MAE is really important here. How did it work in your case with only the logarithm?


### [TuMinhDang](/darkswordmg)
Congrats your team on the 3rd place!  
the MAE would measure the average absolute difference in the log-transformed
space. This approach is often used when the data is skewed or spans several
orders of magnitude, as it helps stabilize the variance and make the model
less sensitive to outliers


### [Tanishk Patil](/tanishkpatil)
Congratulation on winning the Challenge! I have a question.  
Can you explain how did you handle the calendar.csv? and what method do you
use to fill holidays?


### [techniquetwice](/techniquetwice)
Hello [@tanishkpatil](https://www.kaggle.com/tanishkpatil)

### Below is main idea when I fill holiday:
  * In data train, test have column "holiday" with values is 0 and 1
  * "fill_calendar2df" will get holiday from calendar.csv(df_cld) to fill for dataframe
  * With each holiday, we mark both before and after the holiday as 1 (treat it as a holiday).
  * With 2 special holiday('Labour Day' and 'Easter Monday'), we mark 2 days before and one day after the holiday as 1(Only 2 days before the holiday is weighted at 1.3 instead of 1, I hypothesize that users order more to prepare for the holiday.)

### Example:
#### Input - holiday Easter Monday:
warehouse | date | holiday | holiday_name  
---|---|---|---  
A | 2024-03-28 | 0 | Not  
A | 2024-03-29 | 0 | Not  
A | 2024-03-30 | 0 | Not  
A | 2024-03-31 | 0 | Not  
A | 2024-04-01 | 1 | Easter Monday  
A | 2024-04-02 | 0 | Not  
A | 2024-04-03 | 0 | Not  
  
#### Output - 2 days before and 1 day after:
warehouse | date | holiday | holiday_name  
---|---|---|---  
A | 2024-03-28 | 0 | Not  
A | 2024-03-29 | 0 | Not  
A | 2024-03-30 | 1.3 | Easter Monday  
A | 2024-03-31 | 1 | Easter Monday  
A | 2024-04-01 | 1 | Easter Monday  
A | 2024-04-02 | 1 | Not  
A | 2024-04-03 | 0 | Not  
  
#### I not fill holiday name for day after holiday
