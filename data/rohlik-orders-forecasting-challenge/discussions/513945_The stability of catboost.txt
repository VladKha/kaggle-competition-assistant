### The stability of catboost
I believe there are people here who have competed in the HomeCredit
competition. The HomeCredit competition calculates the loss of model
stability.
In the HomeCredit competition, I found something interesting: the offline CV
of the lgb model is good, but it is average when submitted, while the offline
CV of catboost is not good, but it is better when submitted than the lgb
model. I think this is because of the stability of catboost.
So what about this competition?

Each competition is different and a model should be analyzed apropos to the
data and the CV score in the competition. Catboost usually performs well in
compliment with other boosted trees but it cannot be generalized, especially
with such small and noisy datasets

If you set `extra_trees=True` for LGB then i think its similar to CAT in this
behaviour…
