### The leaderboard is not split sequentially
Hello participants,
I wish to inform you that the public and private leaderboard are unlikely to
be created sequentially. I conducted a simple probe test to determine this a
while ago.


## Experiment Details
Experiment Details | Result   
(LB score) | Inference  
---|---|---  
* Submitted the sample submission file   
* This is my usual opening submission benchmark | 0.5108 | * Benchmark  
* Placed garbage values after the first 31% of rows (row 124+)   
* First 123 rows have the same value as in sample submission   
* If the score stays the same as the sample submission file, we infer that the public LB comprises of the first 123 rows | 0.8255 | * The public LB is not the first 123 rows of data  
* Grouped by the location and placed sample submission value for the first 31% rows across the grouper   
* Other rows are garbage values   
* If we obtain the same score as in sample submission, then we infer that the public LB is split by location groups | 0.8612 | * The public LB is not split with location and date sequence  
  
  
Associated kernel for the last experiment is
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ravi20076/rohlik2024-publiclbtest)
We therefore infer that the leaderboard is likely to be split in a random
fashion, without any sequence discerned from the experiments above.


## Why do we do this
  * We strive for CV-leaderboard relation as a base for any competition, especially if the dataset is small. 
  * We often ensue such trials to ensure we can structure a reasonable CV scheme to check our subsequent experiments
  
This process indicates 2 elements for future endeavors-
  1. The CV scheme should factor the non-sequential split between public and private LB 
  2. We are currently unsure of the inclusion/ exclusion of locations in the public LB. This too is important for the final model evaluation
Thoughts? Comments?

Thank you for conducting this experiment. I have learned how to test which
data is in public leaderboard and which data is in private leaderboard.To be
honest, the test data for this game is too limited. On the one hand, there is
randomness in the scores, and on the other hand, as is done in open-source
high scoring code, I found that training a model with the last few weeks of
data is better than training the model with all the data. That is to say, we
don't need to train a model with strong generalization ability at all, we just
need to fit these test data.

Hi [@ravi20076](https://www.kaggle.com/ravi20076),  
Thanks for the thorough analysis. Very helpful. I can confirm that it is not
split sequentially and that all locations are in public LB.
