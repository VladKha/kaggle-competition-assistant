### Model's and Public score difference
Stuck with a problem that my model's mean absolute percentage error is closed
to 0.05 something that metric is requirement of this competition, but on
leaderboard my public score is 0.4732, So I am little bit confused why there
is huge difference between these two scores and how to resolve it .

Check for model complexity. It tends to overfit .

This is bound to happen. This data is very small and such issues may arise due
to even a slight overfitting risk

Cross validation inevitably leads to data leakage, but it shouldn't be that
bad either.


### [KALPESH BHOIR](/kalpeshbhoir)
Recheck your metric calculation and overall implementation,also check for
overfitting.
