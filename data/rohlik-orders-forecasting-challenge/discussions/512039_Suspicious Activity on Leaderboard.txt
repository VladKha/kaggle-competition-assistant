### Suspicious Activity on Leaderboard
I'm pretty sure (with benefit of doubt) that this behavior is not aligned with
the competition and Kaggle rules for the following reasons:
  * It could be that one person has two Kaggle accounts.
  * Or that two people are sharing code without being in a team, which also violates the rules.

Especially looking at the submission time which is just 5 minutes apart and
the exact same score. I think the best is to check the submission files to
compare the values. Thanks

I think there should be a rule ---> no novices are allowed to join the
competition. This is not a good approach. Using multiple accounts for one
submission to block the top leaderboard is unfair.

[@abdmental01](https://www.kaggle.com/abdmental01) one may become a
contributor and then cheat. Being a novice does not imply that one is a
cheater. Also, we are not 100% sure of this case too, so one is innocent
unless proved guilty [@abdmental01](https://www.kaggle.com/abdmental01)


### [Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah](/abdmental01)
Your point is also valid, [@ravi20076](https://www.kaggle.com/ravi20076).
However, both scores are equal in this case. Let’s examine this further.


### [Etienne Kaiser (郑翊天）](/etiennekaiser)
That's very true (referenced to "block the top leaderboard"), recently a lot
competition using identification which should help, I don't know the
requirements (governance) to use that. Anyway having multiple accounts which
give you more submissions per day isn't really helpful here, as this
competition can be done totally offline. Further I even think to submit just
twice at the end to not have the curse of choosing a model (no regrets at the
end when seeing the results, hehe).
Edit: I think novices are not the problem itself, like
[@ravi20076](https://www.kaggle.com/ravi20076) says.

That is really suspicious I think we have to report it

I just wanted to ask, there's no other meaning. Why don't you participate in
the competition but keep an eye on the latest developments? Are you looking
for a suitable time to enter?


### [Etienne Kaiser (郑翊天）](/etiennekaiser)
No worries, I want to join, but currently I'm in a dense exam period, which
wouldn't be the right time to join any competition (yet). I will join in 3
weeks, but not to leave dead ends, I rather join when it's the appropriate
time. In my last competition I also joined 1 months after the start, to also
see how the competition is developing. I like to observe first, then reason
and decide, rather than rush into it. Thanks for the question :)
