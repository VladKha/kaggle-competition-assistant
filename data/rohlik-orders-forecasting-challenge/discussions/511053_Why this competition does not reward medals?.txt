### Why this competition does not reward medals?
Hi,
I was surprised to see why this competition does not award medals. Seems like
a fun challenge :(

This is a community competition, it does not award medals

Yes, thank you. Maybe I need to rephrase, why not a regular competition
instead of a community one. That's what I was wondering.

Hi [@snnclsr](https://www.kaggle.com/snnclsr), this was an agreement with
Kaggle based on the size of the competition.

I see, thank you for sharing the background. Time-series competitions are
always nice and can attract a lot of attention. That's why I was curious
(community ones tend to be less).
