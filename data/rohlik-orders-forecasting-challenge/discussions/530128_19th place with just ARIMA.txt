### 19th place with just ARIMA
[My final submission is literally my public
notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yantxx/rohlik-forecasting-statistical-
learning). The only difference is that while my public notebook focuses solely
on ARIMA, for my final submission, I added exogenous variables based on the
'Warehouse Analysis' section, transforming the ARIMA models into ARIMAX.
I began this competition with zero knowledge of time series models like ARIMA.
I decided to go in this direction because we had so little data that using
GBDTs felt like overkill, and simply doing an ensemble of boosting trees
seemed too boring to me. So, I bought some books on time series models and
spent the first month of the competition studying intensively.
After completing my studies, I published the notebook and made the final
submission within about a week.
I really enjoyed the learning process and will definitely use this approach
for future time series projects. Thanks to the host for being very active in
the forum (especially during the first month). I hope to see more from Rohlik
in the future.
