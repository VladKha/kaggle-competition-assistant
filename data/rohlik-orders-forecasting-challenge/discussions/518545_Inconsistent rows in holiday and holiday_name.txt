### Inconsistent rows in holiday and holiday_name
Notice when you clean your data there are some rows in the holiday variable
that are **zero** and they're already holidays and vice versa (non-holidays
with **one**)

Hi, Those days are within easter holidays in CZ. They are not specifically
public holidays but the time between Friday and Monday is considered easter
holidays. (with Fri and Mon specifically public holidays) It's not an error.

Hi [@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera),  
Do you have any data on the expected sale date? I mean the warehouse discount
plan.


### [Mohammed Mustafa](/mohammedmustafa648)
I got it, thank you ðŸ¤—


### [Etienne Kaiser (éƒ‘ç¿Šå¤©ï¼‰](/etiennekaiser)
I think that's a mistake, yes


### [amatas](/abelmatas)
Yes, you are right.  
According Dataset Description: 0/1 indicating the presence of holidays
I consider 0 means disable ans 1 enable.
