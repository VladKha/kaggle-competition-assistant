### Are GPUs allowed for the final submission?
I might be completely blind, but have not seen anything about this. Is it
allowed?

You need to submit a file of predictions here- you can choose to create them
with CPU/ GPU/ Kaggle/ Colab/ local PC/ cloud GPU provider/ excel file, etc.

Same to you [@ravi20076](https://www.kaggle.com/ravi20076)! Will be
interesting to see whether or not there will be a huge shake-up. I'm kind of
50-50.
