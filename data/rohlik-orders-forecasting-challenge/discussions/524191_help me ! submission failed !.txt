submission = pd.DataFrame({'id': test.as_data_frame().index, 'orders':
preds_test_df['predict']})  
submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
Try This,  
sample['orders']=y_pred  
sample.to_csv('submission.csv',index = False)

Hey! [@barirahzainal](https://www.kaggle.com/barirahzainal)  
I just looked into your submission.csv file. The id column values are not
appropriate. They are index values if I am interpreting correctly (starting
from 0). But, the submission csv needs to have ids as column values.


### [AC](/ahsuna123)
This line from your notebook needs to be fixed:
> # Create submission file
>
> submission = pd.DataFrame({'id': test.as_data_frame().index, 'orders':
> preds_test_df['predict']})


### [Barirah Zainal Abidin](/barirahzainal)
okay sir thank you ! 👍

hi sir, i have questions, i'm using these code # Predict on the test set  
y_pred = model.predict(X_test) but submission is failed again . i got 0.05
score . these time i'm not using h2o .
# Create a submission DataFrame
submission_df = sample_submission_df.copy()  
submission_df['predicted_orders'] = y_pred . so how to fix it?


### [AC](/ahsuna123)
Hey! So sorry for the late reply!
[@barirahzainal](https://www.kaggle.com/barirahzainal)  
I see you are using
> submission_df['predicted_orders'] = y_pred
**"predicted_orders"** column here, but the submission needs to have
**"predict"** column. Replace the predicted_orders to predict and check if
it's working. Also, it'd be helpful if you can post a screenshot of the
structure of your submission csv file to figure out, if the cause of problem
is the order of columns.
