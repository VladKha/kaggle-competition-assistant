### Highly Correlated Features with the target
User_activity_1 and 2 turns out to be highly correlated features to our
target.  
Here's a list of feature correlation with "Orders". Used Orange software to
evaluate.

I am currently trying to predict the current orders using user'activity2 from
90, 180, and 365 days ago, and the ridge regression result is 0.0885

Thanks for sharing that, can you elaborate on what is “orange”? seems like
it’s a statistical package software or something.


### [AC](/ahsuna123)
Oh yes, it's a software with widgets that performs the task at hand, for
instance pre-process, visualizing embeddings and even train a regression
model. There are lots of widgets, I just named a few.  
Here's the link to the software : [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/)  
Hope, it helps! :) [@ahmedalghali](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedalghali)

amazing, this is the first time I ever heard of it, I will definitely check
it, thank you!

It is high correlation yes, but if you check for each warehouse separately
you'll find that it is much less (even though still quite high with > 0.7 for
all warehouses and even > 0.8 for some).
If comparing the correlation of lagged values against target one can also
notice that the lagged user_activity_2 in general has higher correlation with
target than the lagged target itself. So maybe lagged user activity could be a
useful feature (as already suggested/hinted by
