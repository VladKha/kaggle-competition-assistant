### seed is all you need?
I conducted an experiment using the current high scoring open source solution.
When the random seed is 2024, the score is 0.423, and when the random seed is
777, the score is 0.397. If there is no scoring method, perhaps we can try
random seeds?

[@yunsuxiaozi](https://www.kaggle.com/yunsuxiaozi) if this is true, then all
of us should brace ourselves for a mighty shakeup in a month's time.


### [Ern711](/ern711)
I agree that a shakeup seems quite likely. I've tested a lot of different
approaches, and for me, the local scores do not correlate with the public
leaderboard at all. The only thing I see that suggests there might not be a
shakeup is if the public/private split was done in a stratified manner, so
that roughly the same time periods and warehouses are in both.

That's true, but it will not give you a significant improvement. This could be
useful once you have a solution ranked in the top 5 or 10
