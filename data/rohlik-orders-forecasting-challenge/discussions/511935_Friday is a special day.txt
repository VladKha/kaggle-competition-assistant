### Friday is a special day
Very interesting to see that Friday is a special day for Rohlik in every
warehouse.
Let's take Brno_1 as an example.

The plot above is designed to analyze and visualize the ratio of orders
received on each weekday, with Friday highlighted. We can see that throughout
the year, Friday has the highest ratio.
Heatmaps can help with the visualization:

> Friday is a special day for Rohlik…
Good observation, like the heatmaps! Friday is not only a special day for
Rohlik ;)  
I think the reason for that is that most people order for the weekend. Didn't
check but I guess it's the same scenario if there are public holidays, more
amount (which doesn't matter here) but I guess some order even twice a day,
like there is no tomorrow. :D

Generally, Fridays tend to have more orders, but the trends can vary by
region.

Hi all! How to specify this in preprocessing? Do we need it?
