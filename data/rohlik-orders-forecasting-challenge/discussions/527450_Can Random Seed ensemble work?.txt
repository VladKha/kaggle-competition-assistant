### Can Random Seed ensemble work?
I read in some of the discussions here, stating how seed 777 is outperforming
the rest. I tried it with the highest scoring public notebook. The seed 42
gave a score of 0.434 (0.375 with seed = 777), which brings me to question,
how about ensembling models on multiple random seeds? My best bet is they
might turn out to be more stable than submitting a single model.

Yeah, it'll surely reduce the variance in the predictions. Ensembling always
works. Nice ideas, time to test it out. thanks

Yep, look forward to testing it! :)
