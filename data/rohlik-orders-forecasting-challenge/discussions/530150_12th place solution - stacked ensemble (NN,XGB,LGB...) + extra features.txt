### 12th place solution - stacked ensemble (NN,XGB,LGB...) + extra features
Thank you for organizing such a fun and engaging competition. I thoroughly
enjoyed participating.
For my approach, I used a stacked ensemble model that included a variety of
models such as XGB, LightGBM, CatBoost and NN. Besides the features discussed
in the forums and public kernels, I also included:
  * Days from the start and until the end of school holidays
  * Days since the last holiday and until the next holiday
  * The day before and after holidays, school holidays, shop closures, and non-public holidays (where the holiday name is specified but the holiday column = 0)
  * The number of holidays in the previous and upcoming week
  * For the first layer, I used multiple models including XGB, LGB, CatBoost, and NN. For the second layer: CatBoost, XGB, and LightGBM.
