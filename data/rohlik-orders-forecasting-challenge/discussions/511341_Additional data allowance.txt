Thanks for clarification [@abdmental01](https://www.kaggle.com/abdmental01) .
Missed that paragraph.
[@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) in theory by external data we can
add more insights to your business case but no problem if external data is not
allowed. I guess you know what Rohlik needs to figure out here at Kaggle.

Thanks [@abdmental01](https://www.kaggle.com/abdmental01). Yes, we advise
against using any external data. More context below.

Hi [@samvelkoch](https://www.kaggle.com/samvelkoch),
Good question. Depends on the data. General rule of thumb is that if the data
is not leaky then it's ok to use it for training. I would be extra careful to
use something for generating the solution though.
Example: we provided weather data in training but did not for testing as that
would be leaky - we don't know the weather going forward.  
Another example: Hypothetically, let's say you find some data for population
density development in the cities. For training it's ok, but not for
generating the solution as that development is not known at the time of
prediction.
Sticking to the data provided is the safest bet. It is very difficult to find
non-leaky data that is something else than calendar events. We will be
checking the winning solutions as we wan't to make sure that those would be
applicable in practice and not a modelling exercise that we can't replicate in
real world.

No, it's not allowed. Read competition rules
