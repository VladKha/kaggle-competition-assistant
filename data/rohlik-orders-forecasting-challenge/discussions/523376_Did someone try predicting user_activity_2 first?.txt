### Did someone try predicting user_activity_2 first?
Hi I was trying to predict user_activity_2 feature first and then input it as
a feature to the overall model but I didn't get any good results. Any one
tried it this way and could make it work?

I’ve found that using Facebook Prophet for this kind of task can be quite
effective Prophet is a robust tool for time-series forecasting and can handle
trends and seasonality well
