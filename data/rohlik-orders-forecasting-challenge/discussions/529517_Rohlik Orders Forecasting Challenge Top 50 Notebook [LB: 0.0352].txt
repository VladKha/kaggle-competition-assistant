### Rohlik Orders Forecasting Challenge Top 50 Notebook [LB: 0.0352]
Hi everyone!
I am sharing the top 50 notebook which I have worked on the following existing
notebooks:
  1. <https://www.kaggle.com/code/wanyanwendi/ensemble-stacking-modified-metamodel>
  2. <https://www.kaggle.com/code/pkuszboi/0-0358-ensemble-stacking-modified-metamodel>
As no medals are offered in this competition, sharing the notebook with only 2
days to go seems fine.
Here's the notebook: <https://www.kaggle.com/jaejohn/public-rohlik-
score-0-0352>
Hopefully, this notebook helps clarify things on improving the LB score.
Some ways you may further improve the score:
  1. Implement a neural network model
  2. Implement a transformer model
  3. Understand the scores of each base model
  4. Understand the scores of each meta-model
  5. Research new papers on the problem
  6. Adjust the number of features used
  7. Explore feature engineering
  8. How about first predicting the missing columns?
Feedback appreciated!

In terms of the score, I would give you a thumbs up, but I believe you haven't
carefully reviewed the two pieces of code you studied, and you've kept the
bugs from the original code, so I won't give you a thumbs up.
