### Submission Error
I am naive to the kaggle competitions. Can someone please tell me why the
submission console is showing me the error that it found 2 columns when the
expected columns are 2 as well. I am attaching the screenshot of my csv as
well for the reference. Thanks in advance for
help:}![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-

You need to remove the index while submitting

Use submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index = False) and resolve the issue

You have to match your submission csv file shape as SampleSubmission.csv file  
and features names as well

You can refer to the submission code in open source code

If you can provide the error screenshot, it'll be helpful.
