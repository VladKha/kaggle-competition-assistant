### Viewing and inferring the churn
Hello all,
We have a moderately high level of churn herewith- the below picture probably
provides a better detail in this regard-

Rank zones | Comments  
---|---  
R1 | * This is indicative of top 100 ranks that remained in the public and private leaderboards.   
* Considering the level of churn overall, this is a success in my opinion  
R2 | * This is a moderately highly dense region that indicates overfitting   
* Considering the small size of the dataset and the overall churn potential in the competition, this was much expected  
R3 | * This is a moderately highly dense region that indicates an upturn in ranks on the private leaderboard from the public leaderboard   
* Hearty congratulations to these participants  
R4 | * These indicate overfitting, but for those participants from moderate public leaderboard ranks to a moderate private leaderboard ranks   
* This was also expected given the nature of the dataset and the nature of the test set  
  

### Analysis of the top 100 ranks
Rank groups | Comments  
---|---  
1- 10 | * Stable teams = 6   
* Teams entering from below = 4  
11-50 | * Stable teams = 18   
* Teams entering from below = 18   
* Teams entering from above = 4  
51-100 | * Stable teams = 9   
* Teams entering from below = 33   
* Teams entering from above = 8  
  
  
We observe a very low level of stability across ranks 11-100 as mentioned in
the table above. This was also expected considering the small size of the
data.

### Additional analysis
Rank changes | Public LB rank | Private LB rank  
---|---|---  
Maximum rank change upwards | 73 | 676  
Maximum rank change downwards | 525 | 51  
  
  
Wishing everyone the best, happy learning and best regards!

Thank you for the detailed analysis on churn and rank stability.

Nice visualization!
I was convinced of a huge shake-up early on in the competition, until I tried
to replicate the LB situation locally.
When doing a time based split to get (more or less) the latest 60 days for
each warehouse in the test set, and then randomly splitting this test set into
a 31% set and a 69% set, I found that the best model on the 31% set was almost
always the best on the 69% set as well. That made me like 50-50 regarding
shake-up.
