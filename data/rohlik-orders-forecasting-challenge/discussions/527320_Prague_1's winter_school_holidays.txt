### Prague_1's winter_school_holidays
hi [@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera)
Hope you're doing well! I was looking at the winter_school_holidays and
noticed something interesting. It seems like Prague_1 has more
winter_school_holidays than the other Czech warehouses. I was wondering if
this is intentional or if there might be a little mix-up in the dataset.
Thanks for your time!

That is an interesting issue. Let me explain some context. The 'winter school
holidays' is a week-long spring break for school kids. However, every
'district' is scheduled for a different week (some coincide, obviously). It is
(or used to be) common that families go skiing during that time. Prague is a
big city, so it is divided into smaller 'districts'. If a warehouse covers
more of them, there are more vacation weeks corresponding to it…  
However, I am quite confused why there aren't more weeks assigned to the other
warehouses too. For example, as far as I know, the Brno warehouse(s) cover(s)
much of Moravia.  
Moreover, there is only Hungarian spring break in the test data and it is much
later in the year (= no snow).

it was probably intentional
