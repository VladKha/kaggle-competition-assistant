### 6th place solution
Hello,
Thanks to the organizers for this interesting competition. Since I have
receive some demands concerning my solution, I'm going to share some insights
about it.
My best private solution scored 0.362 (2nd place) but only 0.415 on the public
LB, so I did not select it.  
**Here is a similar but more stable solution that scores 0.361 (public) and
0.379 (private)** :
[Notebook__0.361_Public__0.379_Private](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vincentschuler/rohlik-2024-public-0-361-private-0-379)
However, I must warn you : even though the scores are good, the CV strategy
seemed leaky to me and one should generally prefer a good reliable and
traditionnal time-split. I took this CV strategy idea in this [great public
notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdmental01/rohlik-starter-v1) and used
it only because it worked, but without much conviction.
With a good CV strategy, I achieved 0.352 (public) and 0.397 (private 6th
place), but I had no time or motivation to improve it since the LB seemed too
unstable to me. If I had to start over, I would only focus on this one.
_Finally, the keys to achieve good scores were :_
  * Feature engineering (as always). An important feature was the number of days before and after the next holidays.
  * Delete strange data during the training phase (20th to 31th december; Munich before 2021-10-01 and Frankfurt before 2022-07-01).
  * Use 4 LightGBM to make the results more stable.
  * Postprocess the predictions to manually correct them in the Easter holidays.
_What did not work :_
  * Use lag features (for instance, mean orders over past months/weeks). It decreased significantly the results with the dubious CV strategy, and had almost no effect with the good one.
  * Manually correct the time-series of Munich and Frankfurt to make them more stationnary.
  * Use different models for ensemble (LightGBM, Catboost and XGBoost).
  * One model per warehouse.
  * One model per country.
PS : excuse me if you find some french comments in my notebook, I tried to
translate them but some may have remained ðŸ˜‰

Congratulation , Finally First Solution.well done

Congrats man! You gave me a good idea of â€‹â€‹the feature engineering by regions
and it's sort of weird that ensemble models don't work
