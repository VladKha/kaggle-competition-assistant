### Issues with data import
I tried to import data into Google Colab notebook and ran into this problem.
Does anyone have any ideas on how to deal with this?

Judging by the indentation of wget, you seemed to have missed to store the
dataframe in a variable, like so, df = pd.read_csv("train.csv")


### [Stas Kolchin](/mordechaichick)
But df = pd.read_csv("train.csv") is just saving the data in a convenient way
into a variable for later use. The issue here is error tokenezing data, and
i'm out of ideas


### [G John Rao](/jaejohn)
Okay, the file might be corrupt. Try re-downloading it, or try loading the
other CSV files to see if the error persists. It's working on my end.
