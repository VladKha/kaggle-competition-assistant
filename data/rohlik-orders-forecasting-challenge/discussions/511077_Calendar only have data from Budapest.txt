### Calendar only have data from Budapest
Both the train and test calendars only contain data from Budapest. Was this
intended? From reading the description of the data, I thought this dataset was
supposed to include data for all warehouses.

Hi [@yantxx](https://www.kaggle.com/yantxx),  
Good catch. Thanks. This is now corrected - it has all the warehouses.


### [Yan Teixeira](/yantxx)
[@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) I have another quick question
Budapest_1 is the only warehouse with a latest date of 2024-03-14, whereas all
the other warehouses have a latest date of 2024-03-15. The first date for all
warehouses in the test set is 2024-03-16, which makes me think that the
training data might be missing the 2024-03-15 data for Budapest.

Hi [@yantxx](https://www.kaggle.com/yantxx) 2024-03-15 was a public holiday in
Budapest - the warehouse was not open.

[@mkecera](https://www.kaggle.com/mkecera) Can you share a MAPE benchmark for
one or more models that Rohlik uses?


### [MichalKecera](/mkecera)
[@yantxx](https://www.kaggle.com/yantxx) yes, we will do it in a few weeks.
