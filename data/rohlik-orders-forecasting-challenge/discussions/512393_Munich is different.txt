### Munich is different
The Prague warehouse was founded in 2014 (or earlier), the Brno warehouse in
2015, and the Budapest warehouse in 2019. These operations were all well-
established when the historical data started being recorded. This is probably
why we see a clear seasonal pattern for these locations.
The Munich warehouse was founded in late 2021, and we can see how the orders
started to grow quickly.

What I first noticed is the increase in orders right after January 2022. This
behavior is the opposite of that seen in the established warehouses, where
orders start to decrease. My current theory is that since the brand is new in
the town, the demand has yet to normalize.
Another important period for this warehouse seems to be from September to
October 2023, when orders started increasing significantly.

Daily orders exceeded 5,000, which is twice the volume of previous periods. It
is clear that Rohlik must have made some type of investment, so [I searched
the news and found this](https://www.rockawaycapital.com/en/2023/10/rohlik-

becoming-shareholder-of-entire-rohlik-group/).
Maybe this information should be consider when forecasting. Will Munich's
orders continue to increase?

Like many, I've found that keeping warehouses separate will definitely improve
on the forecasting. And it makes sense, as they're based in different
countries and it looks like their business strategy, its history, and its
future are different. Germany is definitely much different than Czech Republic
and Hungary, and its market is showing a different path in growth. I think
this should be taken into account, probably by estimating different models for
different time intervals of the series. This also means there could be two
approaches, one more relevant for the competition itself, and one more
relevant for a real-life scenario.


### [Aryan Pahwani](/aryanpahwani)
Another reason for that increase could also be Covid ending.
In all 3 Nations, there was a massive Covid wave right after 2022, which is
what led to the decrease in sales.
New cases of Covid in Germany ended around April 2023, according to
[worldometers.](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/germany/)
There seems to be an increase in every other store around that time as well
even though the investment, Bringmeister E-Supermarket, is [only available in
Munich.](https://www.algolia.com/customers/bringmeister/)

Thank you for your discovery. I noticed that the 'orders' of' Munich_1 'have
increased from 1000 to 6000, which has brought difficulty to the learning of
the model. I calculated the' MAPE 'separately for each' warehouse 'and found
that it is particularly large. On the other hand, when fine-tuning the
prediction results, I can also give it a larger weight.


### [Yan Teixeira](/yantxx)
I'm happy to help. Indeed, keeping track of each warehouse's MAPE is a good
way to identify where the model is struggling
