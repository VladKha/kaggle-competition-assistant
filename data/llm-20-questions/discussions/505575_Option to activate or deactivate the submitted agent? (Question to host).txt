### Option to activate or deactivate the submitted agent? (Question to host)
My old agents are getting paused as I submit new agents. Don't you think the
control should be given to the participants? My old agent was performing well
compared to the new agent but my old agent got paused because of the rule.
**Suggestion:** Put a limit on the active agents but the activation,
deactivation control should be given to the participants.

We should be able to chose which agents are active, like any other competition
imo. Now my first agent is deactivated, but it scored better than my second,
so i rather have it running over the second.

This is from the overview page. I'm not sure how it is actually working on the
LB tho.

At max only 3 agents can stay active. If you submit fourth agent then the
first agent will be deactivated. I guess you have submitted less than 3 agents
till now. Try submitting more, then you will know.
