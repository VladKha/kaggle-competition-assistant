### Disabled due to competitions active submission limit.
Hi,  
I have made 4 submissions, the latest one is performing the best, the second
best performing agent is the first one which i submitted. but the first one
has stopped playing games because it says "Disabled due to competitions active
submission limit." how can i make sure that the agent which i submitted first
is still in the competition?
