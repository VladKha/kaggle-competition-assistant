Thank you for sharing these valuable resources!
[@crsuthikshnkumar](https://www.kaggle.com/crsuthikshnkumar)  
The papers and articles you’ve listed are excellent for gaining deeper
insights into the capabilities and challenges of LLMs, especially in the
context of multi-turn reasoning and question-answering tasks.
The links to research and the Wiki page will certainly help participants
better understand the underlying concepts and strategies for the LLM 20
Questions competition.  
Best of luck to everyone competing!
