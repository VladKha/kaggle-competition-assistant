### What is "jane"?
As a non-native language speaker, Jane has always been just a name of a
person. Checked out in GPT, and it also thinks "Jane" is just a name.
Understanding that as of now, in the set of secret keywords being used in
episodes there are 500 location (from keywords.py), 500 things (from
keywords.py), and 1000 new things (the hidden set), I have a real problem to
understand where the keyword "Jane" came from.
Can someone help?
BTW. My bot trained for persons also was magically able to guess this name ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

[@kowjan1](https://www.kaggle.com/kowjan1) does the keywords.py file contain
things?? mine contains only locations, i am looking at the wrong file?

Look at GitHub Kaggle environments. There you will find keywords with places
and things

Slang. For a girl or woman.

This does confuse me. According to the [previous
statement](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/512955#2884981),
`people`category has been deleted, maybe given name has been classified as
`thing`?


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Might be a typo or something for example "jane" is close to "jade"
