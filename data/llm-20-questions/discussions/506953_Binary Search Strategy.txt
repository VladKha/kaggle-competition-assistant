### Binary Search Strategy
Is there a team that is pursuing binary search strategy to eliminate half the
possibilities each time? It would require a lot of tokens in the question.  
I would like to join that team. I’m a teacher, and only a code dabbler but I
like that strategy from playing “guess who.”

The max question length is 2000 characters which would limit this strategy.


### [Cody Creed](/codycreed)
I know so little about this that I believe it’s still possible. Now I will
have to try.

Would something like this be allowed in this competition
though?![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-
