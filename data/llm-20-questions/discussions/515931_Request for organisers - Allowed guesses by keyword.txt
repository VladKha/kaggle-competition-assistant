### Request for organisers - Allowed guesses by keyword
`keywords.py` only supplies alts information for places (e.g. omitting the
country name of a popular city is still acceptable - this is useful
information for us!). The things category is quite difficult mostly because of
the specificity required for each item.
It would be great if we could be supplied with the alternative words allowed
in guessing (assuming there are some) for the things category. E.g. during a
game, this way we could know if 'glass window' is acceptable when 'stained
glass window' is the keyword and so on.
Otherwise, I'm getting the vibe that people will start using these
lexicographical ordering bots (re:
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/515801)>,
since only they can narrow in on the precise wording of an item…
