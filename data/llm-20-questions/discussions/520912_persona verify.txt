### persona verify
How can re-verify persona? I exhausted all the available time slots. After
this, it is not turning on camera in my laptop.

**1\. Clear Browser Cache:** Sometimes clearing your browser cache and cookies
can resolve issues with persona verification.
**2\. Use a Different Device or Browser:** Try using a different device (if
available) or a different web browser to see if that resolves the issue.
**3\. Contact Support:** Reach out to the platform's support team or customer
service for assistance. They may have additional steps or solutions specific
to their verification process.
**4\. Wait and Retry Later:** If technical issues persist, consider waiting
and attempting verification at a later time when the system might be more
responsive.
