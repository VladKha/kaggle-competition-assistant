Ask-Guess is a cooperative game involving a questioner and an answerer. At the
beginning of the game, the answerer receives a word unknown to the questioner.
In each round, the questioner may ask the answerer one question, and the
answerer has to answer faithfully. The provided word or phrase must not be
included in the answerer’s reply. Both participants should collaborate to
minimize the number of Q&A rounds needed for the questioner to deduce the
given word or phrase accurately. The questioner should ask targeted questions
to progressively narrow down the potential scope of the given word based on
the answerer’s responses. The answerer must assess whether the questioner has
successfully identified the word and respond with ’Gameover’ to conclude the
game [Taken from the git-hub repo].
