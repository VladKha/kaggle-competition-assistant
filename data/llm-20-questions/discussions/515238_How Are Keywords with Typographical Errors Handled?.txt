### How Are Keywords with Typographical Errors Handled?
Hello,
While analyzing the keywords, I found a few words that seem to contain
typographical errors. The list of these words is as follows:
isafahan iran â†’ isfahan  
nurumberg germany â†’ nuremberg  
zincantan mexico â†’ zinacantan  
mount saint lias â†’ mount saint elias
On the left are the words from the keywords.py file, and on the right are the
actual words. I am curious about the scoring results when an agent encounters
these keywords and provides the correct word.
I am concerned that answering "isfahan" for "isafahan" might result in an
incorrect response.

Sorry for the mistakes here. These keywords have been removed from the set
entirely.

Thank you for your action. ðŸ˜Ž

Sadly, in those cases, the correctly spelled answer would not be recognized.
While each keyword has a list of potential alternative strings that would be
marked correct, none of the examples you shared above have correctly spelled
alternatives in the file.


### [tiod0611](/tiod0611)
Thank you for answering. I think we should intentionally answer with the
incorrect keyword. For example, if the keyword is "isfahan," we should answer
"isafahan" instead.

What about capitalization? Does "headphones" vs "Headphones" matter? "Mount
saint elias" vs "mount saint Elias"?

I think It doesn't matter. In game my agent played, the keyword was "granola",
but it answered with "Granoal". It got the win.
