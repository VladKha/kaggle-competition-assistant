### Agent produces only -NaN as output
Why is this happening? This screwed up my score by a lot.

This has been fixed. Discussion is
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/508278).
It is my understanding that the NAN scores did not affect any scores. (i.e. it
was just like the game never happened).
