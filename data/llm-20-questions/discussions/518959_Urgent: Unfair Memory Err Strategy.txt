### Urgent: Unfair Memory Err Strategy
I found that if someone's agent gets an Err, all the other 3 Agents will get a
+ Point.
This can be misused by questioner prompting as much words as possible (lengthy
prompts), so that if the answerer's agent has less available memory, it will
result in an Err and all points will be given to the other 3 agents, while the
Err agent get a - point.  
Even if they all didn't guess the correct keyword.
This strategy is vulnerable to those who don't have a condition to give a
backup answer when there is no output from the agent, especially for those who
are using big size LLMs and lengthy answerer prompt too.
Should be fixed by not giving + points to the other 3 if an agent gets an Err.
(Only - point to the Err agent.)

This was discussed
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/508415)
and other threads.

But it's still not fixed yet?

I don't see an issue. The rules are pretty clear that a question can be up to
2000 characters. Each agent should be responsible not to run out of time or
memory.

The non-error teams used to receive like +150 points! It is much better than
it was.

Thanks for the heads up, will need to put in safe guards for my own agents to
make sure it doesn't error out like that.
