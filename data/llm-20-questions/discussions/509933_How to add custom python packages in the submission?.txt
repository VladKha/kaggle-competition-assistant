### How to add custom python packages in the submission?
Hi, all. I'm a new hand to Kaggle. I want to know how can I know what packages
are in the online evaluation, and whether I can add new packages (for example,
from pip install). It seems that this can be done through submitting a
notebook. I'm wondering if I can add custom packages through submitting the
tar file? (Such as adding an requirements.txt?). Thanks for any help and
response!

`pip install -q -U -t /kaggle/working/submission/lib your package`
I was using this

Hi, thanks for your response! But if I need to submit a main.py file, where
should I put this line in?ðŸ˜€

Hi. Put your `main.py` file in `/kaggle/working/submission/lib` and pip
install everything into `/kaggle/working/submission/lib`. Then finally tarball
the entire folder `/kaggle/working/submission/lib`. Afterward submit the
tarball to the competition.
Also note that inside your `main.py` file you will need to add to system path
so that it can find your pip installs:
    
    
    KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH = "/kaggle_simulations/agent/"
    if os.path.exists(KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH):
        sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH, 'lib'))
    else:
        sys.path.insert(0, "/kaggle/working/submission/lib")
    
    
    content_copy
To see an example of tarballing, see code cell #3 and #4 in starter notebook
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/llm-20-questions-starter-
notebook). Afterward we submit `submission.tar.gz` to the competition.
