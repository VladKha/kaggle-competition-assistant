The file was not updated on website Kaggle but you can see the new file in
Kaggle's GitHub [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-
environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/keywords.py).
Note that there are also hidden words on the public LB that are not shown any
where. To view these hidden words, we need to download all the games played on
the public LB and extract the keywords. This was done in public notebook
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/waechter/llm-20-questions-games-
dataset/notebook) and saved to a CSV file
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/waechter/llm-20-questions-games-
dataset/output?select=keywords.csv)
