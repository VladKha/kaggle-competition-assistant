We cannot pick the 3 active agents. They are selected automatically as the
most recent 3 submitted. (So to replace our current agents we need to submit
new more recent agents).


### [francesco fiamingo](/francescofiamingo)
Thanks, but i dont understand the logic, at least in testing phase


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
I don't understand the logic either.
Perhaps Kaggle doesn't want us to be able to turn bots on and off. For
example, when our bot achieves a high score, we can then disable our bot to
prevent the score from decreasing. Then in the last 1 hour of the competition
we can enable the bot and get 1st place public LB.
I think our final position in public LB is our seed going into private LB, so
maybe what I say above could be an advantage. There are probably other ways to
exploit the LB by turning bots on and off whenever we like.


### [gguillard](/gguillard)
I guess the logic is that it was easier and quicker to implement this way.

That would be **deeply unfair** , since the scoring system (which is [already
a
lottery](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/521385))
relies on the number of games played to assert its confidence on the scores.


### [francesco fiamingo](/francescofiamingo)
Overall , not having the algorithm how the score is build (agree there is a
lottery feeling - beeing not possibile to test outside with scoring) , i would
love to try multiple options (different LMM, or different promts, or different
setting) but this model of submission prevent this …and delute the most
intersting part of this exercise which is the learning process…… maybe only
way us to aggregate in team and share experiences…


### [francesco fiamingo](/francescofiamingo)
Ps becouse of that i was 115 now a sad 445…..
