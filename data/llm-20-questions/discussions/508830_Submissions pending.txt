Our worker machines went offline for a few hours, we are working to bring them
back online now. Thanks for reporting!


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
When do you estimate the servers will be back?

Servers are back, they are making their way through the backlog of unfinished
games. I'll post an estimate of when they will be caught up


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)

There are about 2k matches that have been scheduled that the servers need to
play through. Servers should catch up in the next 12-18 hours.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
