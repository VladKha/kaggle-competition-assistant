### Why Do NaN Occur in LLM Agent Competitions?
I often observe NaNs occurring in agent-based competitions. Is there any way
to effectively observe or detect these NaN in order to understand why they
happen?

We've made some improvements to the back end and the NaN issue should be
resolved!

I've been looking into this, the NaNs are a result of a failure during the
initialization phase (when downloading all the agents). This is the first
simulation competition we've run where the agent sizes are all 10-20 GB so I'm
guessing the large size is causing as issue somewhere. Looking into a fix for
this currently.

The issue isn't just that the game crashed; the real concern is that it likely
impacts the scoring. For instance, I had a game that crashed, and after that,
the agent didn't play any games for two hours (which is unusual because it
should have started a new game immediately after the error).

nan will make the score converge, if agents are lucky to get nan at high
score, they will be staying there …

On the other hand, if an agent is unlucky to get nans at low score, they will
be staying there too…

I was this case lol

[@yuanzhezhou](https://www.kaggle.com/yuanzhezhou) if these games are not even
recorded or accounted for, the ranking algorithm doesn't even know they
happened and so they should not affect the scoring directly. Although they
could affect it indirectly if there's some statistical bias with respect to
the pairings for which they occur -- then some pairings would "avoid" being
evaluated properly.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
So far they are a mystery, it looks like they're not even logged in the
system, i.e. meta-kaggle.
