### kaggle docker
I'm trying to pull the latest kaggle docker image using "docker pull
gcr.io/kaggle-gpu-images/python:latest" but permission is denied. How can I
obtain access to the up-to-date kaggle dockers on Google Container Registry?
thanks,  
John

Did you already try doing `gcloud auth configure-docker gcr.io` first?

Yes, I had executed that command and the other google-cloud-cli formulas
listed on the GCR website but I still ran into permission denied. I did get
the pull command to work after following the link to upgrade my Kaggle
notebook to a google notebook and in the process creating a pay tier gcloud
account (without spending any money on Google). Google may require you to
associate your gcloud account with a payment method (apart from your general
gsuite payment method) in order for your account login to pass cli
authentication to work for the docker pull
