You need to add "LLM 20 Questions" competition to your notebook (via the pane
on the right "add input") and a new option will appear to submit your
compressed solution, but before make sure everything works and you have added
all dependencies. Check out the starter notebook.

Hi ,  
Thank you for your response,  
Just was curious if there is a road map on how i can tackle the problem, any
strategy which i can research on and try to follow? As I am new to this field,
I am a bit confused.
