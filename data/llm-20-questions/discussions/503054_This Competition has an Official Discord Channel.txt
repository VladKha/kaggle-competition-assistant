### This Competition has an Official Discord Channel
In addition to this competition forum, you can continue the discussion in our
official Kaggle Discord Server here:
# [discord.gg/kaggle](http://discord.gg/kaggle)
The Discord is a great place to ask getting started questions, chat about the
nuances of this competition, and connect with potential team mates. Learn more
about Discord at our [announcement
here](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/429933). Here are a few
things to keep in mind though:
**1\. Discord Competition Channels are 'Public'**
Discord channels for specific competitions are considered 'public' spaces
where you are allowed to talk about competition details (it will not count as
private sharing).
**2\. Discord Competition Channels are Not Monitored by Staff**
Kaggle Staff and Hosts running competitions will not monitor Discord or be
available to answer questions in Discord. Always post important questions in
the forums.
**3\. Keep the Good Stuff on the Forums**
Please keep important questions, insights, writeups, and other valuable
conversation on the Kaggle forums. Discord is intended to be a more casual
space to discuss competitions and help each other, we want to keep all the
best information on the forums.
**4\. Remember to never privately share competition code or data**
Please remember that private sharing of competition code or data is, as
always, not permitted. Code sharing must always be done publicly through the
Kaggle forums/notebooks.
I hope you’ll join us to chat on Discord soon!
