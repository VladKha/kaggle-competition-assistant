### Deadline extended?!
If you checked the overview page, you will find that deadline for final
submission is August, 27.  
What’s wrong?  
Is deadline being extended?!

6th of August was deadline for joining the competition.
Yesterday 13th we had submission deadline.
Now the last two weeks mostly nothing will happen, just running the agents on
the private leaderboard on the private test set for two weeks.
TLDR:  
Nothing changed, we have two weeks where the agents can be tested on the
private LB.
