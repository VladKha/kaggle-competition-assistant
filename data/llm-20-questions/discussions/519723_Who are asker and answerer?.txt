There are two roles `questioner` and `answerer`. The top name is `questioner`
and the bottom name is `answerer`. The `questioner` both asks questions and
makes guesses. The `answerer` only responds yes or no. Below is an example:
    
    
    Round 1
    Questioner: Is it a country?
    Answerer: yes
    Questioner: France?
    
    Round 2
    Questioner: Is the country in Europe?
    Answerer: no
    Questioner: China?

Notice how the `questioner` says two things each round and the `answerer` says
one thing each round.

### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Yes, the game environment visuals are a bit confusing, but yes in this case
kothiwsk28 was the questioner.
