### Can models be too smart?
I was looking through my model logs of a new agent that I added all my changes
to and I was extremely impressed later I thought that my model might be too
complicated and too "smart" for other agents for example when my model is the
questioner lower/"dumber" answerers might not be able to even answer
correctly. I am not fully sure if this is a problem so I wanted to know what
the wider community felt because I am sure that everyone who is regularly at
the top has at least once considered this. Here are some images of my model's
logs not sure if I just made a good/best agent or if other people already have
similar results.

_P.S. I am not trying to be narcissistic but I just had this question after
what in my mind was a "godly" model. I also have many more "smart" question
images from my model but can't post them here if you want a link with a file
of my agent logs I can create a google drive or something (just ask)_  
_P.P.S. Also not sure if anyone else has a model with results like this but
this is my first good questioner model previously I had a good answerer that
carried my score_

In case of LLMs, I just assume that both models will rely on more-or-less same
knowledge from the training set.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Are you sure this isn't to smart? Because I think that other models might not
be able to answer correctly.

### [tr](/toma78)
Well, extracting that knowledge is whole other matter :)  
But I expect models to fail even on simpler questions.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Exactly my thinking! That's why I was sad when I saw how good the model was.
The questions probably eliminated the most possible guesses but were too
complicated. Well, whatever I'll just prompt engineer my model to be simpler
lol.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
This has got to be too smart ðŸ˜‚

ðŸ˜€  
Well, it guessed correctly at least.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
That's true but it was a validation run so no points ðŸ˜­
