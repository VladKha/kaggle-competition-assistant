### How do you guys normally improve or edit the strategy of the model?
By looking at game logs?  
I am just curious of the approach

Personally, I find the game logs of the public matches to be somewhat helpful,
but they are less useful when your the other agent isn’t very intelligent—like
the bots that always say “no” or always ask the same question. Sadly, that
happens far too often, so I think I found more value from just running matches
in a notebook.

I have locally run book which would run my two agents together. that way i can
debug and improve slowly
