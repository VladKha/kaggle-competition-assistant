### Example of successful round
I am new to the challenge and just skimmed through the submissions and some
episodes. I am yet to find a successful episode, i.e. an episode in which an
agent correctly guessed the keyword. It would be even more interesting to see
an episode that also contains some questions vaguely narrowing down on the
keyword.
Do such episodes exist (yet)? In this case, it'd be very helpful if someone
could point me to such an episode.

Hi. There are successful episodes (but I agree that 90%+ episodes are
unsuccessful). View the top teams on the LB and search for a game where one
team scored >25 points. Here is a recent example from my bot which occurred 3
hours ago:
  * [[1st] Chris Deotte 604 (+40)[1st] Kaustubh 603 (+57) vs [3rd] Briaha 625 (-15)[3rd] huiqin 600 (-32)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-episode-54912547)

Yes. It may be helpful to make a Kaggle notebook that finds all the successful
episodes from all played games. So we can view and analyze them. Also we can
compute the success rate.
UPDATE: it looks like Waee [@waechter](https://www.kaggle.com/waechter) is
beginning to do this
