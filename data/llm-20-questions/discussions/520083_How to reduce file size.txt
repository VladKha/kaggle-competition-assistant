### How to reduce file size
I've tried Gemma2 and Gemma 7b-it, and the submission file exceeds in both
situation. What could be the solution?

What compression algorithm are you using? The submission file caps out at 100
Gb's, and most ~8b parameter models take up only around 10-15 Gbs.
The `pigz` compression programme is what most people are using for this
competition:
    
    
    !tar --use-compress-program='pigz --fast --recursive | pv' -cf submission.tar.gz -C /kaggle/input/path/to/weights . -C /kaggle/working/submission .
    
    
    content_copy
You can also just use the following to clone every file in your `submission/`
directory, where -9 indicates the maximum level of compression:
    
    
    !tar -cf - -C submission . | pigz -9 > submission.tar.gz 
    
    
    content_copy

What? My cap is 19.5GB…

Yuang, maybe you are referring the the limit output size to a Kaggle notebook.
If you create a 100GB file locally, you can upload it and submit to this comp.
However the output folder of a Kaggle notebook caps at 20GB i think.
