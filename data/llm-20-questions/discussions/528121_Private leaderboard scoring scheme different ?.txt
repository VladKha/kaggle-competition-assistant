### Private leaderboard scoring scheme different ?
Just probed into one of the first game plays and curiously found that
deductions are not taking place in private leaderboard run? Are we still in
testing phase?

The leaderboard is the maximum score of your two bots. One bot lost points,
one bot is still at 600, so the leaderboard says 600.
