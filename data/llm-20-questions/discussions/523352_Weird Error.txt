### Weird Error
One of my submissions ran for 5 days with 65 episodes without any issues,
regardless of the ranking. But in the 66th episode, an error was recorded as
early as Round 13, even though there was nothing abnormal with my bot or our
team's bot. Have you experienced something similar? What could be the possible
reasons?

I have same problem, when some game I get error when load model but some game
not, log is limit in 1000 characters so hard to identify error.

[@manh152924](https://www.kaggle.com/manh152924) My error happened during an
episode, but the loading error appears to be a tricky one‚Ä¶

hard to tell‚Ä¶ perhaps the questions and guesses were really long and you
include the history in your prompt leading to a out-of-memory error or
exceeding the context window of the model? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[@matthewsfarmer](https://www.kaggle.com/matthewsfarmer) Thank you for your
comment! I checked the entire replay, and it doesn't seem to be on my end.
It‚Äôs really difficult to be certain, but if the issue is caused by the
opposing team's loop, which could be probable, it would be better to fix it
for all participants before entering the lock-up period.
