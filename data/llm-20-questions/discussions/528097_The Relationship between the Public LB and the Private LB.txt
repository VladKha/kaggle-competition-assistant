### The Relationship between the Public LB and the Private LB
As the private leaderboard is calculated with approximately 70% of the test
data, I believe that the ranking immediately after the public LB deadline is
based on approximately 30% of the test data. In that case, what do you think
the correlation between the public LB and the private LB will be?
