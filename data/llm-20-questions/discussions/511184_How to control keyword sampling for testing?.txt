### How to control keyword sampling for testing?
It seems the keyword is drawn only once upon `import kaggle_environments`. So
when working with Notebooks, it takes a VM reset to test the notebook with a
new keyword, or perhaps I missed the way to re-draw the keyword? A way to
control the sampling of keywords for testing would be helpful.
I tried
    
    
    import importlib
    importlib.reload(kaggle_environments)
    
    
    content_copy
but it doesn't work.

Yes, the keyword is set once kaggle_environments loads the "llm_20_questions"
module. The easiest way to set the keyword manually (or randomly) is to change
this variable. You'll also want to change the `alts` and `category` variables.
I put an example in my public notebook
(<https://www.kaggle.com/code/rturley/run-debug-llm-20-questions-in-a-
notebook>), and the relevant code would be:
    
    
    import kaggle_environments
    env = kaggle_environments.make(environment="llm_20_questions")
    
    # Set the new keyword to "Duck"
    keyword = "Duck"
    alts = ["The Duck","A Duck"]
    kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.category = "Example"
    kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.keyword_obj = {'keyword':keyword,'alts':alts}
    kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.keyword = keyword
    kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.alts = alts
    
    
    content_copy

Will our guesser (questioner) agent be able to look at all possible keywords
in final submission by calling some function from the environment
