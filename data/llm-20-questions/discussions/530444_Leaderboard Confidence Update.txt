### Leaderboard Confidence Update
I'll be stopping matches for a few minutes to reduce confidence for all
agents. Due to the high number of ties the confidence of some agents is still
significantly higher than it should be. This causes a large amount of games to
be spent on these agents (who tie almost every game).
Any agent over 75 confidence will be dropped to 75 confidence after this
change.
Depending on the match distribution I might follow this up with another to
reduce confidence even further.

It seems like you're planning to take a temporary action to adjust the
confidence levels of agents in a competitive environment, likely to ensure a
more balanced and efficient distribution of matches. By reducing the
confidence of agents with disproportionately high confidence, particularly
those involved in frequent ties, you're aiming to prevent excessive focus on
these agents and promote more diverse matchups. This approach suggests that
you're closely monitoring the match distribution and are prepared to make
further adjustments if necessary. If there's anything specific you'd like to
address or clarify, I'm here to help you craft a response.

hello [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard), there are few hours before the
end of the competition, but the top segment of the leaderboard is still random
walking. Great research made by [@lohmaa](https://www.kaggle.com/lohmaa) and
[@jademonk](https://www.kaggle.com/jademonk) show how significant the luck is.
I suggest the following solution (of course, it is still not ideal, but I
think it will better rank top solutions):
  1. Extend the competition timeline for a week.
  2. Every day 'disable' the worst half of remaining agents by manipulating with sigma - for example, increasing the confidence of 'remaining' to 75 and lowering 'exited' agents to 45.
  3. After 6 days the will be 835*2/64 ~ 26 agents which will play hundreds of games at final round to make the distribution closer to ground truth.

Dear all, i think that the most important is not to win or loose(money is
money i know…), but to learn (much more valuable then the money) , i think the
winning team should share they approach and maybe dedicate a forum discussion
, we are the pick of the iceberg of AI …sharing , open source and cross
learning , can make us stronger, hope that organizators will think how to
manage such forum/session…

[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) Thank you for responding to Kagglers'
request for increasing game frequency. As there are only two days till the
end, would you consider increasing the ratio of more difficult keywords for
top agents (e.g. multi-word keywords) so that a more robust convergence may
form? It has been pointed out that the private keyword set has a lot lower
proportion of multi-word keywords than the public keyword set. This might also
give non-alpha agents a good chance to shine. I would love to see alpha and
non-alpha agents' performance on these challenging ones because right now
simple keywords are like a random lottery for gold region agents.


### [yuanzhe zhou](/yuanzhezhou)
Can we increase the frequency of plays again without changing anything else
(key word list frequency, etc)? It's good to see agents playing more, no one
want to see their agents stay AFK the last day of competition …


### [yuanzhe zhou](/yuanzhezhou)
It seems that some people do not want to play lol


### [gmin5y](/gmin5y)
It seems like most agents are still playing actively (including yours) and
converge to a new balance. I think the biggest problem for your proposal is:
if we simply increase game plays, how can we establish convergence with only
less than two days left? Anybody who is not happy about the ranking could
easily request the same thing again on the last day. Also, do we increase the
frequency of game play for all agents or just top players? It is impossible to
make it fair.


### [yuanzhe zhou](/yuanzhezhou)
Well, playing more will only make it fairer. It is the most simple way to
establish convergence. I do not get your point that it will make things
unfair.  
Our real problem is that we only have limited amount plays possible given the
computational resources.


### [gmin5y](/gmin5y)
I don't think the argument: More games -> fairer is true. As we have seen from
several restarts, each time the increase in game freq brought turbulance in
lb: some lucky agents get out of the pit, some unlucky agents fall. Simply
increase the number of games does not guarentee a better convergence.
As for making things unfair, I mean the following: with fixed amount of
compute, simply "play more games" does not work. The decision is actually
"which group of agents should play more games", which will be biased one way
or another.
The restart a day ago is giving chances to all agents and I personally just
wish this game to end peacefully without any more shocks… Hope to learn from
all leading agents' solutions and discuss about how to make next competition
better.
I know I am not in a position to say this but stay hopeful for your agents.
There are still two days and anything could happen.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
I agree with more games, but I’m afraid we have to add more difficult keywords
into the pool. For the past 1-2 days there is frenzy of top bots randomly
swapping places without any meaning, because they all cover 90% of current
keywords. Add more difficult keywords, say, 500, in the last 20-30 hours will
help the LB converge and find the best agents.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@khahuras](https://www.kaggle.com/khahuras) I agree the variability is high,
because the margins are tight, but I think the way to handle it would be to
reduce the minimum sigma, so the score update would decrease as well and it
would take more than just 1 game to climb or fall. Although lower minimum
sigma could reduce the number of games for these agents, so this would need to
be counter-balanced somehow. But all this would obviously not be in favor of
agents who fell out a bit (and would be in favor of those that are high), so
any decision has plenty of factors and dilemmas and I don't want to say much
anymore, let's believe in the best judgment of the decision-maker..


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Yes. Decreasing min sigma from 45 to 20 would solve it.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@khahuras](https://www.kaggle.com/khahuras) 20 sounds very low, and anyway
this would obviously favor the current leaders, so you see, I cannot recommend
it. Maybe I shouldn't even speak about it…


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Well, 75 is too low… It will cause quite a surpise big stir to the top bots. I
think 100 should be good first…


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
Indeed. You can find a lot of agents with a sigma > 75 in the top 100. We
might as well stop the competition right now, hand out the medals and prizes,
since clipping sigma with 75 is essentially freezing everyone in their current
positions.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
I agree 100 could be a better cap to start with… but anyway, hang on
everybody, storm is coming!…


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
why do you thing the storm is comming, if the sigma will be the same or
decreased?


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Decreasing sigma will cause many matches for all bots with same sigma, because
the algorithm prefers high sigma bots to play. It will cause many games and
unexpected pairings, leading to heavy punishments or heavy reward. At this
stage of the competition with only 3 days to close, we will have another
storm, and we don't know exactly what will come next by Kaggle staff…


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@azakhtyamov](https://www.kaggle.com/azakhtyamov) The sigma cap means that
the algorithm will start selecting agents more uniformly, so more games in
top100 as well. Even though low sigma will be unaffected and the score update
for the low sigma will remain low, more games means more movement. (At least
according to my understanding of the current match-making.)


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
In theory, you are right. In practise, your bot plays 3-4 games per day and
mine plays 3-4. However difference in sigma between them is 3-4 times as well.
So I don't think it works this way.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@azakhtyamov](https://www.kaggle.com/azakhtyamov) One of your agents has
sigma about 100 and it doesn't play a lot just like sigma 50, that's true. But
I think that's because for the match-making sigma 50 and sigma 100 are both
well below the mean over all agents.


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
My point is that by clipping the sigma, you’re not reducing the number of
agents that need to be “resolved,” you’re just limiting their sigma. The game
frequency distribution will remain the same, as all the games will still go to
the agents with sigma == 100. This doesn’t mean that the bots in the top 100
will play more. It would be far more effective to freeze the bots with 600
points or less since they don’t have a chance anyway.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
OK, maybe you're right, maybe it's not going to be a big storm, but I bet an
increase.. let's see what happens.. ,)


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
First, bots from bottom half of the table will play wildly with each other,
wildly… Then a bunch of them will rise, and some will fall, then those who
rise will play plenty of matches with the top bots, causing big stir. Even if
their matches won't resolve, pairing the highest sigma=75 with the lowest
sigma=45 is much more probable, and the frenzy will never cease


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
to rise, they need to win at least once. it's almost impossible if you play
with bots with 600 points or less.


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
previous win was +71, now it's +21. Well, gg.


### [yuanzhe zhou](/yuanzhezhou)
GG, win score reduced by half now :/


### [Jonathan Chan](/jonathanchan)
Despite my LLM agent able to guess the correct keyword with a high reward of
13, the score only increased by +12. The opposing guesser is weaker though.


### [Jonathan Chan](/jonathanchan)
Wish the cap was 100 but it seems my (previously lucky) LLM agent was
definitely one of the targets with an earlier sigma of just less than 90 (and
decreasing).
Wow. What a storm. Played ~~30~~ 34 games already since reset and it doesn't
seem random that the first 6 matches were against alpha agents and my LLM
agent was assigned the role of questioner/guesser for all of these. Immediate
correction by losing 5 straight matches, including the first loss with a
~~repeat~~ duplicate keyword "whale tail" that's known to be on the list of
quite a few alpha agents, and then "ohio" (place?) as a keyword. In total,
~~20/30~~ 24/34 games were played as guesser.
In the meantime, my unlucky alpha agent only played 2 games and still did not
encountered any alpha agents which would boost its score.
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) : It seems the deadline has been
extended by a day until Aug 30 but there's no official announcement.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@jonathanchan](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanchan) just to help clarify, the
deadline extension has been announced alongside the "confidence reset" in the
other pinned thread.. also, if by "repeated" you mean duplicate, then it seems
no -- "whale tail" was not on the public list.


### [Jonathan Chan](/jonathanchan)
[@lohmaa](https://www.kaggle.com/lohmaa) : The announced end date before was
extending to Aug 29. However, it is now ending on Aug 30. As for "whale tail",
I do mean duplicate and did not use the term old keyword.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@jonathanchan](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanchan) Aug 29 23:59 GMT+0 is Aug
30 6:59 ICT.. so if you mean duplicate, then I think no, "whale tail" was not
in the public set.. at least I can't see it in my public set file.


### [Jonathan Chan](/jonathanchan)
[@lohmaa](https://www.kaggle.com/lohmaa) : We are in different timezone
indeed. Before the latest reset, the deadline was Aug 29 6:59 ICT. I'm sure of
that. As for the "whale tail" comment, I'm just frustrated it's reused as I
don't really see many repeat keywords in my matches.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@jonathanchan](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanchan) I'm sorry but I think
you're confused.. the deadline extension to Aug 29 23:59 GMT **has been
announced** , but in **your** time zone it is Aug 30 6:59, that's why you
think it's Aug 30 while in fact it is Aug 29 which has been announced. I'll
give up on the keywords, because maybe "whale tail" is in your version of
public keywords file and not in mine, we would need some oracle to tell.


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
Do you think it's fair? How about the agents that don't tie every game and
have a high sigma because your game engine does not give them an opportunity
to play?


### [prashant kumar](/prashantkumaryt)
**Update on Confidence Adjustment:**
To address the high number of ties, I’ll be briefly pausing matches to reduce
the confidence of agents above 75 to 75. This will ensure a fairer game
distribution. Further adjustments may be made based on how matches play out.


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
They should have paired the agents from the 0-700 zone with agents from the
700-inf zone without giving negative points to the agents from the 700-inf
zone. It’s as simple as that. Interventions in the sigma only added randomness
to the competition and should be avoided at all costs.


### [prashant kumar](/prashantkumaryt)
Thanks for your feedback. Pairing agents from different zones without
penalizing higher-rated ones is a valid approach. I understand that the
current adjustments might introduce some randomness, and we'll definitely take
your suggestion into consideration for future improvements!


### [yuanzhe zhou](/yuanzhezhou)
It benefits more team in the middle, some agents are playing like crazy.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
It depends which place you call middle. I am in the 200's with my modest non-
alpha agent. I don't feel any advantage there
