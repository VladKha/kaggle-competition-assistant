### Animation of Gold Medal Winners
# Top 11 Gold Teams
This is an animation of LB scores distribution of all teams during Kaggle's
LLM 20 Question Competition's 2 week evaluation period with the final 11 Gold
Medal winners highlighted. There were 835 teams and 3 types of solutions:
`Full Agent Alpha`, `Half Agent Alpha`, and `Pure LLM` (i.e. no Agent Alpha).
The `Full Agent Alphas` took all the Gold medal positions!
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdeotte/Kaggle_Images/main/Aug-2024/animation4.gif)
The evaluation period was 2 weeks. During this time, every team played many
episodes against other teams. After each episode, a team's LB Score was
updated and a team's Sigma was decreased. (A win or loss lowered sigma while a
tie did not affect sigma). Teams with the highest Sigma played about 24 games
per day while teams with the lowest Sigma played about 1 game a day. The
Sigmas created a confidence interval. Each team's true LB score was considered
to be `True Score = LB Score plus/minus 2 times Sigma with 95% confidence`).
# UPDATE 1: Kaggle Notebook Published
I share the code to make this animation
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/make-animation-of-winning-teams)
(without sigma side right plots). Each frame of the animation is a plot from
`matplotlib`. We save each plot to disk as an image file. Then we read them
into a Python list and use `PIL` to create the GIF animation.
# UPDATE 2: Observation with Sigma Added
I added sigma over time to the animation. We can now see how the "sigma reset"
(described
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/529606))
on August 21st affected the Private LB. When we watch the animation above, we
see how the `Full Agent Alphas` (top11 teams' scatter plots) stop moving
around August 21st because their sigmas have become low after their initial
gameplay.
At this point, the `Full Agent Alpha` LB scores histogram is one bump. Their
initial LB climb was the result of playing with all 835 Agents as partners
(because everyone started at score 600). Agent Alphas got paired with both
good and bad partners.
Then there is a "sigma reset" (sigma reset to 200) and the good `Full Agent
Alphas` (top11 teams) start playing many games again. This time they partner
with other Agent Alphas (who share the same LB score) and jump upward a second
time and split the `Full Agent Alpha` LB scores histogram into two bumps. The
`Full Agent Alphas` in the right bump (top11 teams) occupy all the gold
positions and leave a gap between their LB scores and the rest of the
competition participants!
(The Agent Alphas in the left bump are most likely teams that forked Agent
Alpha notebook without changing the keyword list which contains only Public LB
keywords. Because also on August 21st, the Public LB keywords were removed
from Private LB (described
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/529606))
so these Agent Alphas began losing matches.)
# Top 50 Gold and Silver Teams
Below lists the top50 teams and indicates which are `Full Agent Alpha`, `Half
Agent Alpha`, and `Pure LLM`. The top11 gold teams are all `Full Agent Alpha`
displayed in the animation above.

I believe we can see how the "sigma reset" (described
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/529606))
on August 21st affected the Private LB. When we watch the animation above, we
see how the `Full Agent Alphas` (top11 teams' scatter plots) stop moving
around August 21st (because their sigmas have become low after their initial
gameplay).
At this point, the `Full Agent Alpha` histogram is one bump. Their initial LB
climb was the result of playing with all 835 Agents as partners (because
everyone started at score 600). They get paired with both good and bad
partners.
Then there is a "sigma reset" and the good `Full Agent Alphas` (top11 teams)
start playing many games again. This time they partner with other Agent Alphas
and jump upward a second time and split the `Full Agent Alpha` histogram into
two bumps. The `Full Agent Alphas` in the right bump (top11 teams) occupy all
the gold positions and leave a gap between their LB scores and the rest of the
competition participants!


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
Yeah, that‚Äôs a solid point. In the beginning, Agent Alphas often play with
random people, so there‚Äôs only a small chance of encountering another Alpha
and penalizing heavily for being not able to play with the others. The Sigma
restart gave them a second chance to compete.


### [VolodymyrBilyachat](/vovikdrg)
Amazing. Could you please post code you used to generate ? I would love to
learn it :)


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Congratuations winning Silver! Thanks for sharing your solution code. I share
animation code [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/make-animation-of-
winning-teams)


### [raconion](/raconion)
Great animation! Always enjoy reading your posts & comments People like you
make Kaggle a better place üëç


### [C R Suthikshn Kumar](/crsuthikshnkumar)
Thanks for sharing nice animation. This makes the competition very interesting
indeed.


### [Tanishk Patil](/tanishkpatil)
Good Work!


### [KKY](/evilpsycho42)
well done, Director Chris! üòÑ


### [Maiernator](/maiernator)
Cool animation, would also be nice for model/data drift.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
Great analysis!


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
UPDATE: I added the sigma of each of the top11 gold medal winners to the
animation. The sigma bars from top to bottom correspond to the scatter plot
dots from top to bottom. On August 21st, we can observe the "sigma reset" when
all bots had their sigmas reset to 200 by Kaggle.
