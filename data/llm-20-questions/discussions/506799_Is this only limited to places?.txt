### Is this only limited to places?
Up till now all interactions seem to be limited to locations. In the private
set are we just limited to locations or can the word be **_anything_** at all
? Are the categories provided somehow?

Keywords will be limited to person, place or thing.
The categories are provided to the answering agent to resolve any ambiguity in
the keyword. For example "orange" the fruit vs "orange" the color (which color
is more of a concept than a thing, so it wouldn't be included anyway).

    The keywords will be within those three categories? This is the real question that needs to be answered by the hosts
