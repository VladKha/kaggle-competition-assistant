### How to timeout an LLM?
Hello players, I tried to use a common timeout function/wrapper based on the
`signal` module.. something along these lines:
    
    
     def handler(signum, frame):
         raise TimeoutError()
    
     signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, handler)
     signal.alarm(timeout_duration)
     try:
         result = func(*args, **kwargs)
     finally:
         signal.alarm(0)
    
    
    content_copy
and it works locally or in notebooks… but not on the host evaluating
submissions (i.e. in the real game):
`ValueError: signal only works in main thread of the main interpreter`
So.. does anyone have an idea how to timeout an LLM if it takes too long to
return?

Have you given a try for asynchronous timeouts ? It continuously check the
task's status and cancel it if it exceeds the timeout.

Thanks for the suggestion, no, I haven't tried anything except `signal`.. do
you mean `asyncio`?… Well anyway it's too late for such experimentation,
especially that the problem is only on the evaluation host, so very
inconvenient to test, and thus it's either a ready-made solution or nevermind.
Matthew's suggestion was very helpful though.

Calculate token generation speed and set max new tokens on generation to match
the time constraints.

Example: ~15t/sec * 60 seconds = 900 max new tokens
