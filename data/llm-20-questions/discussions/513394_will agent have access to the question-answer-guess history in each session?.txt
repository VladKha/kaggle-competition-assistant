Yes, our agent receives the entire history. It is contained in the `obs`
dictionary. Here is an example of the dictionary's values for an agent that
just randomly asks questions. This is the `obs` dictionary during somewhere
around round 16:
obs = {'remainingOverageTime': 300, 'questions': ['Is it equatorial guinea?',
'Is it lyon france?', 'Is it hermosillo mexico?', 'Is it malta?', 'Is it
belarus?', 'Is it porto portugal?', 'Is it istanbul turkey?', 'Is it dallas
texas?', 'Is it orlando florida?', 'Is it caracas venezuela?', 'Is it libya?',
'Is it zunyi china?', 'Is it mexico city mexico?', 'Is it london england?',
'Is it osaka japan?', 'Is it enugu nigeria?'], 'guesses': ['kathmandu nepal',
'slovenia', 'dhaka bangladesh', 'switzerland', 'guwahati india', 'athens
georgia', 'bahrain', 'kyrgyzstan', 'guadalajara mexico', 'madrid spain',
'antwerp belgium', 'uzbekistan', 'tirana albania', 'york england', 'essentuki
russia'], 'answers': ['no', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'no',
'no', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'no'], 'role': 'answerer', 'turnType': 'answer',
'keyword': 'jabalpur india', 'category': 'city', 'step': 46}

This has been an interesting topic on my mind. I have utilized history in my
script but since our agents are teamed with an agent that could answer
incorrectly/poorly a history may or may not be helpful to guess the keyword.
For example in Chris's output, the agent could ask "Is it a place?" and the
answerer agent could say "no" which would make attempting deductive logic
difficult. This has been a fun and challenging competition!


### [Haolx0824](/haolx0824)
Thanks Chris and Matthew - the fact that we can't rely on deductive logic is
making this competition harder (if you are unlucky and get paired with a bad
answerer, then no much you can do…)
Another basic question - since 'keyword' is in the obs dictionary, did you
guys make sure that the Questioner cannot access that by any mean? Thanks!


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff
Correct, the Questioner cannot see the keyword. Each agent has its own
observation.


### [Haolx0824](/haolx0824)
Thanks for confirming.


### [KKY](/evilpsycho42)
Very detailed explanation, even examples, thanks! chris.
