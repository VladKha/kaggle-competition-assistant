### Will all agents play with the same frequency on the hidden test set?
Currently, old agents do not play much. In these settings, old agents with
high scores have the chance to remain the leaders, and old ones with low
scores have almost no chance to grow in skill. Therefore, I have questions
regarding the evaluation on the hidden test set.
  1. Will all agents play at the same frequency on the new vocabulary of keywords?
  2. Will the skill rating be reset to 600 for all agents before the rerun?

The competition host has the freedom to adjust the frequency of matches based
on their observations regarding the quality of the score convergence toward a
stable set of final rankings, so (1) might be hard for them to answer without
losing that flexibility.
Regarding (2), if you look at the internal scoring data, you’ll notice that an
agent has a mean score that we observe on the leaderboard and also a standard
deviation. The standard deviation decreases after each match, reflecting more
certainty around that agent’s score. I believe in similar Kaggle environment
competitions, the host reset each agent’s standard deviation but not the mean.
