The agent from Chris Deotte is in error, see `Answer: none` and `[Err]`  
Probably due to the keywords/category change.

Got it but the point is other two opponents got +19 which is fine, but Giba
got +5 which shouldnâ€™t be there. Ideally if one of the player of a team is
giving error then that person should get negative score but the second team
member should get 0 instead of giving +5.

I agree, this a been pointed out in the discussion
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/508415>  
They made a change:
> A fix for this should be rolling out tomorrow. The reward when an agent
> fails after this should be net zero. For example the failing agent might get
> -21 and the other three get an average of +7 each.
But i'm not sure it works as intented since here the reward is 19+19+5-13 !=
zero

The values themselves won't equal zero, especially depending upon the
uncertainty of each agent.
