### Encountering another problem when submitting
My model using now is Gemma 2 9b it. During Validation process, the agent 0
log shows like this, and there is no content in agent 1 log.
`[[{"duration": 1.089666, "stdout": "", "stderr": "Traceback (most recent call

Has anyone met this problem?

It seems that AutoConfig can not match Gemma-2 in transformers right now,you
can only use AutoModelForCasualLM to load it.


### [Yuang Wu](/yuangwu)
Wow, good advice, I will try it. Thanks gwh


### [Yuang Wu](/yuangwu)
Seems like AutoModelForCausalLM will also use AutoConfig… Now I have no idea


### [gwh666](/gwh666)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(  
"google/gemma-2-9b-it",  
device_map="auto",  
torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16  
)  
try it?


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
You will need to pip install a more recent version of Transformers that
includes code for Gemma2


### [Yuang Wu](/yuangwu)
Yeah, I saw the advice in Huggingface, but I have already run "pip install -U
transfromers", but still useless
