### How to install new transformers version for load llama3.1?
I try to use new llama3.1 model, and recieved error when install, seem
transformer cannot upgrade, it requied 4.43.1 to run, agent log is:
    
    
    [[{"duration": 35.35021, "stdout": "new trans\n4.41.2\n\n", "stderr": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/kaggle_environments/agent.py\", line 50, in get_last_callable\n    exec(code_object, env)\n  File \"/kaggle_simulations/agent/main.py\", line 56, in <module>\n    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id,\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/models/auto/auto_factory.py\", line 523, in from_pretrained\n    config, kwargs = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/models/auto/configuration_auto.py\", line 958, in from_pretrained\n    return config_class.from_dict(config_dict, **unused_kwargs)\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/configuration_utils.py\", line 768, in from_dict\n    config = cls(**config_dict)\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/models/llama/configuration_llama.py\", line 161, in __init__\n    self._rope_scaling_validation()\n  File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/models/llam"}]]

It is error if you don't upgrade tarnsformers. I was use below code to
upgrade:
    
    
    import subprocess
    subprocess.run(f'pip install --no-index --find-links "/kaggle_simulations/agent/lib" transformers', shell=True, check=True)
    import transformers
    from importlib import reload
    transformers = reload(transformers)
    print('new trans')
    print(transformers.__version__) # 4.41.2
    
    
    content_copy
but transformers stuck in 4.41.2. Anyone can help?

Anyone managed to find a solution to this? I am having the same issue.
Unfortunately what [@cdeotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) is suggesting
doesn't work for me at the moment… (great notebook nevertheless by the way!)

Hi [@cdeotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) ,  
I was install new transformers version(it show 4.43.2) on submit environment,
but if we try to load llama3.1 we will recieve error, seem it have 2
transformers version on env and I can't handle it.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
We cannot install during submit. We must install during commit and save the
installation files into our tarball. Then we submit our tarball.


### [TuMinhDang](/darkswordmg)
I was install it and zip to tar file, after install it from main.py file when
submit, but I get problem as above. Are you try submit with llama 3.1? If not,
you can try and see agent log when submit.

…submit with llama 3.1? If not, you can try and see agent log when submit.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
I think you can use my starter notebook
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/starter-code-for-llama-8b-llm-
lb-0-750). In code cell #2, add `pip install -U transformers`.
