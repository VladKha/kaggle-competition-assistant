### #Solved: Cannot submit: Your Notebook cannot use other competitions as a
data source in this competition.
I cannot submit, even though I don't use other competition's data.  
Have to use this llama
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/junglebeastds/llama3instruct> because I
cannot get access to the official LLAMA3 on Kaggle.

Hey can you share a reference notebook with this model, will be very helpful,
as even I am yet to get access.  
PS: I don't mean the notebook that gave you this score


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Isn't "Digit Recognizer" another competition, i.e. playground comp?


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
This is the first thing I tried, but for some reason, I cannot delete it :D  
Need to create a notebook from scratch probably.


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
yeah, thanks for the help, a clean notebook works
