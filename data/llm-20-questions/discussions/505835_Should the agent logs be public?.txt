### Should the agent logs be public?
This is the log of the latest game of (at the time of writing) 1st place Team
Rigging vs 33rd place Pavel Pavlov:

I think the team names are wrong (!?) but anyway that's not the point, what
happened here is that Team Rigging (I think) used the binary search method to
deduce the final guess, they started with asking if the keyword is in one of
the categories, then if first character is in the fist half of alphabet, and
when the pool is small enough they started asking if the answer is in a
sublist until they have the correct guess.  
There it goes, I knew the winning asker's strategy for that game.  
In previous bot arena competitions I guess the bot behavior was much harder to
reverse engineer just from the game log, but for 20 Questions the method above
is a proven strategy. At the worst case I can just download all the questions
from the top teams and analyze them to build my own, is that fair?

I **think** it's intended by the competition designers. Similar to past agent
based competitions: [halite](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/halite),
[connect-x](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/connectx), you can openly see
the strategy of each team as the game plays out. We don't know the exact logic
and code used to produce the questions, but that can be easily inferred when
the solutions are very simple.
For what it's worth this our current solution is only works because we know
the subset of categories and words used in the public/(pre-deadline)
leaderboard. Because of this, I don't think ultimately the public leaderboard
is going to be a good indication of agents what will perform well on the
private/post-deadline leaderboard.
Top teams might choose to not submit their best agents until right before the
deadline so that their strategy isn't revealed. But in the end the public
leaderboard is pretty useless anyways so 🤷‍♂️

[@suicaokhoailang](https://www.kaggle.com/suicaokhoailang) We will be changing
out the list of words _after_ the submission deadline and then we'll wait for
the scores to stabilize. Any agent assuming a fixed word list will perform
quite poorly.
> Final Evaluation  
>  At the submission deadline on August 13, 2024, submissions will be locked.
> From August 13, 2024 to August 27th, 2024 we will continue to run episodes
> against a new set of unpublished, secret words. At the conclusion of this
> period, the leaderboard is final.

Why aren't there 4 team names shown? Shouldn't there be two for each team? One
questioner and one answerer for each
edit: maybe the other two teams are at the bottom? It is a bit confusing who
is on what team and what role, though

Yes, two teams are at the bottom. The team names at the top are a visual bug,
I'll fix that.
