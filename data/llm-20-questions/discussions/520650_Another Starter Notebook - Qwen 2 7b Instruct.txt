### Another Starter Notebook - Qwen 2 7b Instruct
In the spirit of Chris Deotte releasing his code, I am sharing a notebook that
incorporates some alternative strategies and a different model. It also
includes an evaluation session and debugger that can be used to improve your
model in real-time in the notebook.
Notebook is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/matthewsfarmer/llm-20q-starter-
notebook-2-0)
I am excited to see some of the different strategies other competitors have
used for this competition as it comes to a close.
Happy coding! Cheers.
