### how to overcome a dumb answerer?
this is one example of so many, where the answerer has no clue and misguide
the asker agent, sometimes i feel like i am so close, but with one single bad
answer, i lose that chance of winning

In your guesser prompt, you may want to give it instructions to make a guess
even if it has inconsistent or conflicting information. Ultimately, if the
answerer isn't 'truthful' the foundation of the 20 questions falls apart.
You could also prompt your questioner in a way that looks for conflicting
answers and clarifies confusion by repeating a question in a different way.


### [kaoutar](/wouldyoujustfocus)
[@matthewsfarmer](https://www.kaggle.com/matthewsfarmer) yeah, i've already
tried warning the asker agent about meeting a stupid answerer, it wasn't bad
but i noticed that sometimes even when the answerer does fairly well, the
asker keeps rephrasing questions which waist time, decreasing the temperature
of the asker agent may help, but truly a bad answerer sucks

First of all, thanks for your public notebook! I just started to build my own
based on your code and some others.  
About this issue, have you tried "Chain of Thought" on the keyword?  
(Then putting the thought in the prompt before producing the final answer)

[@ratthachat](https://www.kaggle.com/ratthachat) i'm glad to hear this, thank
you, about the Chain of Thoughts, i haven't tried it yet. certainly i will.
