### submission problem(Pls help me)
I am a beginner in this competition.  
I just tried to submit a notebook but it's keep saying "Validation Episode
failed(Error)"  
What is the problem?

hi, you can download the agent logs and see the failure. You'll see either a
traceback of a crash, or something about the model taking way too long to load
/ respond

I have tried different LLMs, Gemma 2b-it worked but got “validation episode
failed” for Gemma 7b-it-quant and Phi 3-mini. I checked agent logs it’s an
empty json file. Idk why?

Any idea of what it could be if the logs are completely empty?


### [Sumo](/sirapoabchaikunsaeng)
normally those will be in other logs, like there are 3 files, the replay logs,
agent1, agent2 (or something, I haven't submitted in a while). But the
exception can be in any of those files.

Check the notebook logs for any clue. My submission logs were empty, I figured
there was an `apt` error in the notebook logs because I disabled internet
while the notebook was trying to install `pigz`.
