### The ranking in other stats
The final stats. Only top 100 agents for brevity, but including both
submissions, sorted by the final score as of Aug 29 23:59 GMT. If anybody
would like to do more analysis, here's the
[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lohmaa/llm20-evaluation-games-
collected) with all episodes and scoring.
    
    
    AWR -- average win reward of all the won matches, which says how quick the winning team was to guess
    ATL -- all time low score, but over the scores after games (i.e. `UpdatedScore`), 
           so we can see who won literally their 1st game
    ATH -- all time high score
    p24 -- no. times played in the last 24 hours (i.e. on the latest full day until midnight)
    AH -- no. times offered alpha handshake as the guesser
    HA -- no. times its handshake was accepted
    FA -- no. times forced alpha questions without the handshake
    Ot -- no. times without any alpha questions
    NWhr -- Kha Vo's no. wins as the guesser after its handshake was refused, so using another strategy
    ha -- no. times accepted a handshake as the answerer
    hr -- no. times refused the alpha handshake

### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
The final update has arrived.
++ It seems we had a glitch in the system just few hours before the finish.
I'm surprised nobody has noticed, or at least I can't see anybody noticing. On
the other hand, perhaps understandably, many people had enough fun and
personally I'm a bit worn out, too. So what happened is that some episodes
ended with a resolution, but the score update turned NaN, sigma turned NaN and
for the final few hours those agents didn't play anymore, which I guess was a
bit of status quo for them…


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
I saw this in your Kaggle dataset. I had to remove those rows before computing
my stats and animations.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Unbelievable, the top spot has changed even there was time the deficit was
more than 100 points! C-number is taken down by the pure golden original alpha
bot. Lady Luck had chosen Agent Alpha and abandoned c-number. In this kind of
critical top spot determining match, c-number is NOT given the questioning
duty, leaving his fate to BPM which is a non-alpha agent. On the other hand
another non-alpha bot is given to Agent Alpha as the answerer, and that is all
he needs to flip the table. What a drama!


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
Unbelievable indeed! c-number seemed too far ahead to be caught, but here we
are after a lucky streak of wins by its challenger.. can c-number win back its
well deserved top spot? It could be a matter of just a few games..


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Here is the game:
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-
episode-55875460>  
where Agent Alpha and C-Number competed head to head and swapped who is 1st
place and who is 2nd place. Agent Alpha's answerer was `Half Agent Alpha` so
the question answer proceeded with `Full Agent Alpha` type questions answers.
C-Number partnership proceeded as `Pure LLM` type questions answers.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
And one more twist, the keyword "hot plate" was not in agent alpha's
dictionary. "hot plates" was, BUT, when "hot plates" was used as the testword,
the answerer correctly pointed to the wrong direction! I mean the direction
was technically correct, but not exactly helpful if the dictionary is
deliberately cleaned from plural/singular duplicates. That's a weird flaw in
the algorithm that I haven't noticed before. Once again and luckily for agent
alpha, the search was finished by LLM extension which was able to guess
correctly.
PS. Heartbreaking to see Kha Vo's so unlucky… hang on amigo!

### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
I dont understand this. Is that 18 “pairs of teams”


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
No, they are single teams. The "-2" suffix just to differentiate between two
submissions of a single player.


### [Andrew Tratz](/jademonk)
Some observations:
Interesting to see that all but one of the top 20 bots are accepting the alpha
handshake at this point.
I think the most predictive stats for the final leaderboard ranking (assuming
we get something approximating convergence) would be related to keyword
coverage of alpha search (e.g. perhaps measured as alpha-accepted win rate
versus non-alpha competitors) and efficiency of alpha search (average reward
for alpha wins). These, in turn, should influence the winner in alpha vs.
alpha match-ups.
With the leaderboard the way it is, alpha versus alpha matches should be
common at this point. C-number's high AWR hints at a very efficient alpha
search protocol, although this stat includes the non-alpha matches as well. My
bots are 0 to 2 in alpha v. alpha against c-number: once with a two-word
keyword and once due to a faulty answerer. Look forward to some re-matches!
Some of the pure LLM bots with few wins and many draws have high AWRs, which
may suggest some lucky early round guesses.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Alpha vs alpha is inevitable. But focusing on alpha efficiency instead of
coverage may pay a price for early matches with non-alpha bots, where one can
take much longer time to reach the top. Then it has less time for alpha match-
ups


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
Stats updated with the questioner/guesser vs answerer split, but still old
data, next update in a few hours.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
All is just theoretical and not exactly accurate. But let's take a rough
estimate on how likely an alpha bot with 85% coverage of the private keyword
list (Bot A) can win against another alpha bot with 95% coverage (bot B). And
suppose the chance you can pair with an alpha answerer is 70%. (bot A has
shorter word list leading to much better chance of winning, but how much
likely to win?)
Suppose in the last 7 days each of the top bot will play 7 matches each day ,
resulting in 50 matches in total. Out of those:
  * 25% of the matches they will act both as answerers. Now it depends on the questioners. I just estimate 50% of these matches will be tied, then each bot will have an equal of 6.25% (global) odds left to win each other.
  * 25% of the matches they will act both as questioners, then A has 0.25 x 0.7 = 18% global winning odds against B. Vice versa, B has 0.25 x 0.7 x 0.3 = 5% global winning odds against A. In other cases it depends on their non-alpha asking ability. I leave this as draw for now.
  * 50% of the matches A will act as questioner, B as answerer, or vice versa. This now depends on the corresponding answerer/questioner they are paired with. I give A with a slight preferred 55% winning chance over B of 45% since A has a shorter keyword list. This leaves A with additional 27.5% global odds and B with additional 22.5% global odds.
In summary, A will have 6.25+18+27.5 = 51.75% win against B and B will have
6.25+5+22.5 = 33.75% win against A. This leaves 14.5% tied games.
So, the odds is not so extreme for A vs B match-ups. Given some other
randomness, it means each team needs some luck factor to land where they want.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
I kindly request: number of times won as being questioner LLM after handshake
refusal, number of defeats by alpha/non-alpha


### [yuanzhe zhou](/yuanzhezhou)
Why my win/lose ratio so low as agent alpha answer? I believe there is no
difference between agent alpha as answer, Just bad luck?


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
There may be different versions of Agent Alpha Answerer (but I'm not sure). I
was looking at one Kaggler (not you but someone else) and I saw that their
Agent Alpha Answerer was making mistakes.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
What a drama. #2 and #3 are non-alpha guessers.
[@linchenyu](https://www.kaggle.com/linchenyu) has an impressive record of
10:0, although his last 4 wins were only as an answerer. Also
[@bhanupm](https://www.kaggle.com/bhanupm) is doing much better as an answerer
recently. Can they hold when paired as guessers? And can I survive this
ordeal?


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
They still have very high sigma


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
**UPDATED to Aug 29th 23:59 UTC**
It is exciting to see both Agent Alphas and non-Agent Alphas doing well. In
the Private LB top 50 (August 29 at 23:59 UTC), there are:
  * 12 teams that do **not** initiate and do **not** accept Agent Alpha

### [Jonathan Chan](/jonathanchan)
[@cdeotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) : My (current top) IC2 agent you
listed above is not an alpha agent. While it accepts the handshake, it does
not initiate one. My other agent is an alpha agent but it's rather unlucky,
kind of like your agents before/after the reset. Glad that one of your agents
made a big gain playing with agent alpha recently and getting a chance with
many games now.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
Great analysis! I am not surprised. If you can accept the handshake and can
answer alphabetical ordering questions properly, then you might be in the gold
zone. Unfortunately, my agent cannot initiate, and doesn't accept a handshake.
It was in the top-20 before confidence reset. Now it is lost somewhere on the
leaderboard as a result of having competed with alpha agents.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
[@jonathanchan](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanchan) Thanks for pointing this
out. I updated my table and fixed Agent Alpha references. (Previously I was
using TeamNames to assign booleans instead of looking at the 2 bots for each
Team)


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
I updated my table to include up to and including Aug 24th. We now have a new
pure LLM bot at rank 2! Team so_so does **not** initiate Agent Alpha and does
**not** accept Agent Alpha!


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Here is a histogram of all 1412 submitted bots (August 24 at 5am UTC). It is
interesting that `Full Agent Alphas`, `Half Agent Alphas`, and `Pure LLMs` all
have lots of bots around the `LB Score = 600`.
We then see that half of the `Full Agent Alphas` broke away from everyone else
and made a bimodal distribution. Next `Half Agent Alphas` and `Pure LLMs` are
skewed to the right trying to climb LB.

bot.png)


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
[@cdeotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) Full Alpha has 2 types: ones that
dominate with updated keywords and ones that copied public alpha which used
old public list. That may explain why we have 2 populations for full alphas


### [Andrew Tratz](/jademonk)
Since there are quite a few capable LLM / Half Alpha agents with high sigma,
it appears that they are able to climb the ranking very quickly (and somewhat
stochastically), often winning a succession of games as answerer. But once
their rank increases they are more likely to be compete against alpha+alpha
pairings and lose games, knocking them back down the ranking.
Given that quite a few bots probably meet this description (basically all of
the decent bots stuck in the "pit", including anyone who forked Kha Vo's
public notebook), I think it's very likely that at least one pure LLM agent
will finish high in the ranking once the music stops at the end of the
evaluation period, although still very hard to predict which one it will be. I
think this reflects more on the nature of the current game dynamics rather
than the strength or weakness of any one bot.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
I updated my table to Aug 26th


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
I updated my table to Aug 27th. We can see that all the sigmas are around 50
now.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
There are **no** `Pure LLM` in the top 20! Only `Full Agent Alpha` and `Half
Agent Alpha` in the top 20!


### [Andrew Tratz](/jademonk)
I suggest reclassifying Full Power Agent and yukky_maru as "Init AgentAlpha =
True". Neither agent uses the "Is it Agent Alpha?" handshake but instead
launch directly into alpha-style questions.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Interesting. Then basically all gold zone is Full Agent Alphas


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Updated with Aug 29th dataset


### [Bhanu Prakash M](/bhanupm)
There is no way that my humble LLM solution can beat your Alpha supremacy.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
Bhanu, please, your LLM is lovely and alpha is a friend.


### [Mahmoud Elshahed](/letemoin)
That is great analysis, actually i have blown in one game "as answerer" and
kicked out.
could you please provide also
  * Ratio of Guesser to total play game, 
  * and correct % when bot is guesser,   
as my observation i may have 1 game as guesser vs 4 as answerer or more.
also i was having 2nd highest AWR, does that we were guessing correct early,
but low sigma and confidence wasn't getting higher score or what ?
Thanks Again


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@letemoin](https://www.kaggle.com/letemoin) thanks for the suggestions, it is
now covered.. AWR doesn't affect the score, a win counts as a win regardless
of the reward. It's just it should tell a bit more about how quickly agents
guess keywords, which is particularly important in alpha-vs-alpha.
++ 18.5 in 2/2 games as a guesser is really impressive, but I guess it
involved plenty of luck as well.. ,)


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Sigma is so important. For top bots they hope to have sigma as small as
possible. Pls update your table frequently. Thanks :)


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
For alpha bots, the ratio of wins or ties vs AH may probably tell how much
their keyword list can cover. Many ties despite given many alpha handshake
means the list is not exhaustive enough, and vice versa


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Strange that the ratio of HA/AH is not roughly the same for top teams. For
many it is roughly 1/3. For some it is extreme, like Benjamin Kovacs or
c-number…


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
I think it depends on whether the agent was in the pit or not, as most bots in
the pit refuse the handshake.


### [c-number](/cnumber)
Thank you for the Interesting stats!  
Could it be more appealing if perhaps guesser and answerer stats were
displayed independently?


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
It could be!, will try..


### [KKY](/evilpsycho42)
Good job！ C-number is so strong … my agent need more episodes 🏓


### [Andrew Tratz](/jademonk)
Very insightful - thank you. Would be great to get future updates of this
analysis too!
Can't wait until my bots get a chance to play 100+ games… if ever.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
Alright! I will update this (overwrite) tomorrow, your agents were temporarily
lower, so they're not here this time.. but here they are:
