### 58th Solution - Simple Rephrase Agent
Thanks very much to everyone who participated in the competition.  
Although there were some disappointing points, I would like to thank the
Kaggle staff for hosting such a great competition.


## Reference
I mainly used the excellent notebook by
[@rturley](https://www.kaggle.com/rturley),
[@wouldyoujustfocus](https://www.kaggle.com/wouldyoujustfocus) below as
inspiration.

### Asker
  * Fixed questions and initial letter questions
  * Eliminate two-thirds of the candidates using a weighted random selection based on the frequency of initial letters in the dictionary
  * LLM temperature=0.99

### Guesser
  * Shuffle QA history and rephrase, then create a description of keywords
  * If gemma have violated the fixed questions or have guessed the previous keyword, I tried again.
  * LLM temperature=0.99

### Answerer
  * Simply create 10 answers in LLM and vote on 10 answers to decide
  * For those who took the same strategy as me, I added "the first letter of the keyword is *".


## Observations
  * The agent alpha by @lohmaa is a genius and brilliant solution, and my solution should have been incorporated into the Answerer at least. 
  * According to [other stats](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/529683), as a questioner, I had **11 wins and 2 losses** , and as an answerer, I had **6 wins and 10 losses**. 
  * To be honest, the answerer didn't put much effort into it, so maybe I should have strengthened it more.
  * The fact that I was able to perform so well with such a simple strategy was due solely to the intelligence of the gemma, and amazing luck.
