### Submit selection
In this competition, I cannot select a submission on the submissions page.
The last three submissions will be evaluated.
Does this mean that I have to manage and fill up the last three submissions
myself with the ones I want to be evaluated?
And do I have to keep the last three submissions that I want to submit as the
final submission at the time of the competition closing?

  1. Yes,
  2. Or you could test out all the models you want and resubmit the best 3 models before the end of competition.
