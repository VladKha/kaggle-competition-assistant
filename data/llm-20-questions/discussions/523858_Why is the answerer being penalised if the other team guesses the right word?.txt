### Why is the answerer being penalised if the other team guesses the right
word?
The scoring system is extremely flawed in the sense that if the answerer is
decent and is guiding the other team's questioner to the correct word, in the
end it the 'correct' answerer who is getting penalised.  
Because of this behaviour, teams are not being incentivized to come up with a
decent answerer. Only if there is a minimal change in the scoring strategy,
this would have been much better.
Your thoughts?

If the answerer is poor, it will be penalized for sure. But if it answers
correctly, it can help win the game, and therefore get a reward. So better
create good answerers
