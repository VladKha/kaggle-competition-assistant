### Check top-teams, they use "does the keyword precede "..." in alphabetical
order"
  * As I already pointed out in the Update keywords discussion, questions like "does the keyword precede… in alphabetical order" are way too effective. I believe agents that ask such questions will win the competition. Such questions almost always lead to the secret keyword, check out top teams!

This is best strategy.(Binary search)


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
It really is. I regret I didn't merge it to my own approach


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
Even few-shot examples with such questions to the LLM would do it.

I ended up not competing but does that mean I was right from the beginning?

[@suicaokhoailang](https://www.kaggle.com/suicaokhoailang) If I may add, yup,
that's almost the winning basis, what is missing is just a simple method for
bisection, e.g. the alphabetical order.. actually I saw your post some time
after I came up with this idea..

Alphabet bisection (agent alpha) is proving to be a highly effective strategy.
Combining it with an LLM as a hybrid has higher chances of winning games. Both
of our finetuned-LLM agents lost against Agent alpha, with those agents giving
good search guesses.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
It is crazy, insanely effective


### [Dawid Motyka](/dawidmt)
There's a longer discussion about it here

[@jeannkouagou](https://www.kaggle.com/jeannkouagou) I also can't explain why
does it work that way, that only "novice" voters are invisible. It's also
difficult to explain why novice accounts would engage in downvoting in the
first place, sometimes even with a great dedication, almost as if those were
double accounts of some really engaged players trying to depreciate others.
Certainly these are only my speculations. If you'd like to press on this
matter, I think the right place is the general forum, although it's not easy
to receive proper attention there.
