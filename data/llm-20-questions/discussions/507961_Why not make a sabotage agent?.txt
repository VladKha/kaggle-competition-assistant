### Why not make a sabotage agent?
In this competition, the pair of Questinior and Answerer get better scores if
they collaborate and don't lie. However what if someone made a purposefully
deceiving agent for making other agents's scores worse? Is this illegal or am
I missing something? Thank you for considering my question!

A Questioner is paired with an Answerer that has similar LB score. A sabotage
agent would eventually have a bad low LB score. So a sabotage agent eventually
will only get paired with teams on the bottom of the LB. Therefore a sabotage
agent should not affect the important top of the LB.

Ohh, Thank you. I'm not sure how I didn't think of that!
