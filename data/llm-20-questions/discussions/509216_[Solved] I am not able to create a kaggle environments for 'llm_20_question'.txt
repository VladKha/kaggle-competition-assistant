I had the same Issue. Check
`import kaggle_environments`  
`kaggle_environments.__version__`
If it is below 1.14.11 do
`pip install kaggle_environments==1.14.11`
and restart the kernel.


### [Rinku Sahu](/rinkusahu1)
I tried to install newer version and then did import but still it is showing
older version of package.

What version of kaggle-environments are you using? Make sure it's the latest
(>= 1.14.11)


### [Rinku Sahu](/rinkusahu1)
I tried to install the '1.14.11' version but after importing and checking
version, it is still showing the '1.14.11'. following things I tried
  1. Uninstall the package '', but import kaggle_environments still works and gives 1.14.9 version. 
  2. After uninstallation, again installed it but still showing older version 1.14.9.
  3. After Installation, I tried to restart the kernal but still older version
