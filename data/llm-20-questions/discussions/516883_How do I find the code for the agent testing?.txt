### How do I find the code for the agent testing?
I am trying to load my model on my local machine from my "submission.tar.gz"
file how do I get the model/agent_fn so that I could test it? Thank you in
advance for any help!

Do you mean you want to run the kaggle env locally on your machine? Or are you
trying to do something else? At any rate this is how I run it locally. Maybe
something in here is what you're looking for. It assumes your
submission.tar.gz is unzipped in a way that main.py is in a folder
./submission/lib (adapted from <https://www.kaggle.com/code/rturley/run-debug-
llm-20-questions-in-a-notebook>)
    
    
    # These are just dummy agents so that I'm not running 4 versions of my agent.
    def simple_agent1(obs, cfg):
        # if agent is guesser and turnType is "ask"
        if obs.turnType == "ask": response = "Is it a duck?"
        elif obs.turnType == "guess": response = "duck"
        elif obs.turnType == "answer": response = "no"
        return response
    
    def simple_agent2(obs, cfg):
        # if agent is guesser and turnType is "ask"
        if obs.turnType == "ask": response = "Is it a bird?"
        elif obs.turnType == "guess": response = "bird"
        elif obs.turnType == "answer": response = "no"
        return response
    
    from kaggle_environments import make
    import kaggle_environments
    keyword = "argentina"
    alts = ["argentina"]
    kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.category = "Place"
    kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.keyword_obj = {'keyword':keyword,'alts':alts}
    kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.keyword = keyword
    kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.alts = alts
    
    env = make("llm_20_questions", debug=True)
    game_output = env.run(agents=[simple_agent1, simple_agent2, "./submission/lib/main.py", "./submission/lib/main.py"])
    env.render(mode="ipython", width=800, height=400)
    
    
    content_copy
I also have some code in my main.py that looks to see if it's running on my
machine or not, based on environment variables, and if it is, it loads the
model from the right relative path and sets the device type appropriately for
my machine.
