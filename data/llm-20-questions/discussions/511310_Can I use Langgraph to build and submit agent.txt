### Can I use Langgraph to build and submit agent
Dear Community,  
Can anyone , please tell me if we can use langgraph / langchain to create the
agents? Or does it need to have pure python implementation without any other
libraries / frameworks?

My understanding is you can use what ever you want as soon you are within
**Timeouts, Limits and Penalties.**  
Questions are limited to 2000 characters  
Guesses are limited to 100 characters  
Timeouts  
Agents are given 60 seconds per round to answer  
Agents have an additional 300 overage seconds to use throughout the game  
Any agent timing out will cause the game to end  
Any answering agent responding with anything other than yes or no will result
in the game ending and them losing the match.
