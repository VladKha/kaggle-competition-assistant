### updating the model during the tournament
Can the model save data/update the mode during the tournament and will this
data be available during subsequent fights?
whether the model must be completely trained locally and after uploading each
new fight starts in the same zero state

My understanding is that we cannot change a submitted model. Once it is
submitted, the weights are fixed.
We can however, download all the game history, train a new model locally to
use past games, and then submit a new version of our model.

yes, we cant, but questions is that the model can do it byself.

Any local files or changes made during a match will be discarded at the end of
a match. The only thing that is loaded into a match is your submission bundle.
So no, your model can't update itself across matches.

I think agents are called by the environment only to get responses, so any
online training would have to take place during their turns/moves… on top of
that, I don't think agents can have access to anything but their pre-loaded
data, and their online experience, which probably would be too short to be
useful..
