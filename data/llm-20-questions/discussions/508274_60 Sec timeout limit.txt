### 60 Sec timeout limit
I am thinking that 60 seconds timeout limit solution to single call to llm
which basically eliminate idea of adding critic. In many cases call to llm
second time and prompt it to verify or criticise can improve results
significantly.
Is that the purpose of the competition so we do single-shot or single call to
llm?
I had critic but have to remove it since i would hit timeout and get
immediately -60 :( so now id rather return dummy question, guess instead of
hit timeout.
