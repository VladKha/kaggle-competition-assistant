### Final Evaluation - Question
Need clarification on the below paragraph please? Does the locked 3
submissions start with a score of 600? or do they carry over previously
accumulated scores from runs prior to August 13th?
"**Final Evaluation**  
_At the submission deadline on August 13, 2024, submissions will be locked.
From August 13, 2024 to August 27th, 2024 we will continue to run episodes
against a new set of unpublished, secret words. During this period only your
three active submissions will be eligible for the leaderboard. At the
conclusion of this period, the leaderboard is final._ "

Logically, it shall **start from scratch on hidden test set** ,
because if not  
with the current public wordlist, you can write script for iteration instead
of model building, this lead to high score,  
and low decremental score in the evaluation period will keep the user up and
won easily.

That's crazy.

Thank You Chris for pointing out to this. I'm not sure if the admins approach
is ideal but helps to be aware. Also explains why some of the top agents are
not being updated
