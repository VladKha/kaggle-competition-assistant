### Scope of keywords.py
A few questions since there is no description (yet):
  * Are the keywords there also the ones actually used for the first phase or are they just for debugging?
  * Will the second phase (private test) contains categories outside of the 3 in there?

[@suicaokhoailang](https://www.kaggle.com/suicaokhoailang) We are considering
a few options here on expanding the word list and giving guidance on
categories for the second phase. We will make an announcement when it's
decided.

It feels like public leaderboard doesn't really represent the private
leaderboard very well.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
True. The solutions which are successful on public LB will be much different
than successful models on private LB. (Because we have list of possible
keywords for public LB but do not for private LB). None-the-less both offer
learning opportunities for the other.


### [Duke Silver](/maximilianmcdonough)
It seems like it could be better to train models on words outside of the
keywords given as well to make the model more adaptive

I have similar questions. From what I gather reading the competition
description and looking at the keywords used in games on the leaderboard:
  * Current games look like they only use the subsection of keywords provided in `keywords.py`
  * After the submission deadline there will be a new set of keywords used.
From the [evaluation
section](www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/overview/evaluation):
"At the submission deadline on August 13, 2024, submissions will be locked.
From August 13, 2024 to August 27th, 2024 we will continue to run episodes
against a new set of unpublished, secret words. At the conclusion of this
period, the leaderboard is final."
This might mean that the "pre-deadline" leaderboard is going to be overfit to
these words unfortunately.

The keywords will be within those three categories? This is the real question
that needs to be answered by the hosts

Stay tuned, we'll make an announcement to address this. Thank you!

any update??


### [alekh](/aleksanderhan)
Is the keyword.py file included in the environment? i.e. can i read it and
feed it to my agent?

keyword.py is indeed contained in the kaggle-environment pip package. However
I advise against using it, agents will not have access to the final list
published after the submission deadline:
> Final Evaluation  
>  At the submission deadline on August 13, 2024, submissions will be locked.
> From August 13, 2024 to August 27th, 2024 we will continue to run episodes
> against a new set of unpublished, secret words. At the conclusion of this
> period, the leaderboard is final.

Will it be just new keywords in those categories or new categories too?


### [Gavin Cao](/gavinxgcao)
"agents will not have access to the final list published after the submission
deadline." does it mean agent could not read keyword.py after August 13? or
the final list will be different from the content of keyword.py?

Looks like there is just those 3 categories!
