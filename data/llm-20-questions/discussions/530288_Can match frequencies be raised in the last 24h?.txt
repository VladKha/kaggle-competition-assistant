### Can match frequencies be raised in the last 24h?
  * It seems that agents have stopped playing frequently again, with very small sigma's this time
  * How can we ensure all agents move to the position they really deserve on the final leaderboard?
  * Would it be possible to accelerate match plays again, as immediately after confidence reset? Maybe for the last 24h of the competition.
