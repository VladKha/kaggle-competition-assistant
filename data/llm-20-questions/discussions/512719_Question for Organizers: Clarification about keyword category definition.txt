### Question for Organizers: Clarification about keyword category definition
The pinned post
(<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/509035>)
says:
"Categories will be simplified into person, place, or thing.  
There will be a few changes to keywords.py (this is the list of possible words
to guess for the game)."
Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi also mentioned in their reply
(<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/510494#2858808):>
"yes, categories will be person, place or thing"
======================
It is important to understand what can be considered as person, place or
thing.  
It is relatively straightforward for "person".
But what about "place" and "thing"?

### Question 1:
Is it safe to assume that there will words in the keyword list for which
Wikipedia article doesn't exist?

### Question 2:
Is a river considered a "place"? Can keyword be "Nile"?

### Question 3:
Is it safe to assume that all keywords in "thing" category are common nouns?
Can for example "Samsung Galaxy S24" be in the list of keywords?

### Question 4:
Is a building considered a "place"? Can keyword be "Taj Mahal"?

How does this keyword file works?

While we can't make any guarantees on what will and will not be in keywords,
the keywords during the competition will be representative of what they will
be after the submission deadline.


### [VassiliPh](/vassiliph)
Thank you! Any ETA when the updated representative keyword list is online?


### [waechter](/waechter)
Question2: yes, `nile` is in the example keyword list, along with other famous
rivers  
I also wonder for the rest, I hope the keywords changes will bring some
examples for each category so we can better understand


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
There will be 2 categories place and object. Place will be any of the current
keywords so it can be the country, city, or landmark. Object/Thing will be a
physical thing like an apple or a dog. I also believe that things like Jupiter
(the planet) will count as things.


### [Pranitha Bollepalli](/pranithabollepalli)
also, do famous constructions count towards it, like Eiffel tower?
