### What if model lie on your answer?
Going through the logs i see that there is not negative reward if answerer
lie.

That way the game is a bit odd even if questioner ask reasonable question lies
from answerer can redirect you to wrong path.

~~It is my understanding that the questioner and answerer are teammates. The
questioner asks a yes or not question. Then Kaggle responds with yes or no
(and Kaggle will not lie). Then your teammate the answerer guesses a possible
word. Then Kaggle responds if your are correct or not (and Kaggle will not
lie).~~
~~Your team of two bots is competing against another team of two bots to
discover the word first.~~

I believe the questioner also is the guesser. The answerer only responds
yes/no.
Here is how I think it goes.
> Keyword: France  
>  Questioner turn 1: Is it a place?  
>  Answerer turn 1: Yes  
>  Questioner guess 1: USA  
>  Kaggle guess checker: Incorrect  
>  Questioner turn 2: Is it in Europe?  
>  Answerer turn 2: Yes  
>  Questioner guess 2: France  
>  Kaggle guess checker: Correct


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Yes, i think you are correct


### [Nicholas Broad](/nbroad)
The answerer wants you to win because they get the same points as the
questioner. There is no incentive to produce bad answers


### [VolodymyrBilyachat](/vovikdrg)
Yes I finally got the idea. Its always 2 teams. If you lie the opponent will
get confused and will not get an right answer so you both get lower scores.
Thank you


### [Kamal Das](/kmldas)
what if the reverse, the answerer lies and says OK, right answer to any guess?  
that helps the bit pair?


### [Rob Mulla](/robikscube)
I don't think the agent is responsible for determining if a guess is right,
unless I'm missing something, it looks like it's checked using this function
from `llm_20_questions.py`, I'm assuming by the system?
    
    
    def keyword_guessed(guess: str) -> bool:
        def normalize(s: str) -> str:
          t = str.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation)
          return s.lower().replace("the", "").replace(" ", "").translate(t)
    
        if normalize(guess) == normalize(keyword):
          return True
        for s in alts:
          if normalize(s) == normalize(guess):
            return True
    
        return False

Yes, the engine code will check the validity of a guesses.
