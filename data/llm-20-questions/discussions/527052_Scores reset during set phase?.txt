### Scores reset during set phase?
Will the scores of current public lb be reset to the same 600 after keywords
are swapped during test phase? It would be not fair for newer submissions if
we keep the current scores as they affect who your teammates and opponents
are. It is much easier to improve faster if you are paired with better
teammates.
