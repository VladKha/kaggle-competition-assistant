### is the keywords.py in current dataset used in public leadboard?
I notice that in the data tab
(<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/data>) keywords.py
still contain the following three category
country  
city  
landmark
But based on
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/523198> the
current keywords should only contain "the things"
Could you please let me know if the current public leadboard keywords is the
same as the one in data tab? or is there any way to have the current public
leadboard keyword?
P.S. I know for the final eval, the keywords is not accessiable. I just would
like to have a look at the current public keywords, if possible.
Thanks!

The current public leadboard keywords is not the same as the one in data tab.
To see the current keywords list you can use
<https://www.kaggle.com/code/waechter/llm-20-questions-games-
dataset/output?select=keywords.csv>

cool, thanks!

So the public lb is now pointless? (Because someone might provide keywords to
LLM to get a higher score?)

You can check this: <https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-
environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/keywords.py>  
But it's strange that there are some current public leadboard keywords that
aren't in here, which probably is a bug
