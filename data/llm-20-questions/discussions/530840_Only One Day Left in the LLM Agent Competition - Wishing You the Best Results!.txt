### Only One Day Left in the LLM Agent Competition - Wishing You the Best
Results!
As we enter the final stretch of the LLM Agent competition with less than a
day remaining, I wanted to take a moment to wish everyone the best of luck!
Itâ€™s been incredible to see the innovation and creativity displayed throughout
this challenge. Here's to hoping that all your hard work pays off with great
results. ðŸš€

Wow, there are 4 hours left and the top 3 teams have LB scores 1249, 1242,
1239. And currently wins and loses changes LB score +/-8. It will be a very
close last 4 hours for Agent Alpha, C-Number, and Tricksy Hobbitses!


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
Scary to think what would be the score deduction for a loss with low-scored
agentsâ€¦ I guess it should be limited to about -25 but we can't be sure how the
algorithm would handle such an artificial case..


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Wow, an unlucky thing occurred. Ioh-Maa's Agent Alpha played **both** of
C-Number's bots. In the first image we see that Ioh-Maa played against
C-Number twice in the last 2 hours. In the second image, we see that
C-Number's best bot only played once against Ioh-Maa in the last 2 hours.
Having two bots above LB score 1200 helps C-Number. Even if his 2nd bot lost
to Ioh-Maa, it doesn't matter since his LB position is his first bot. So Ioh-
Maa needs to beat C-Number twice to hold his ground!

Yes, that was a major slip and chances for the top spot are buried, but still
I hope it's not going to get worse because me and my agent we actually feel
very lucky to be where we are. I can't imagine how it is for the other 7 or 8
agents playing for the 4th and 5th. It's going to be a matter of 1 lucky
strike I guess. Maybe some players can take it lightly, but for me it would be
difficult, as this competition was my focus for the past 12 weeks.

Well, stressful for the top-5, but entertaining for competitors in the 200's


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
Yes, good luck to all the alpha agents. It is quite tough at the top of the
leaderboard; lots of rollercoasters:)
