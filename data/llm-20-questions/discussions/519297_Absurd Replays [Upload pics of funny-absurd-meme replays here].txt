Not technically a replay since I was working my agent in a notebook, but
still‚Ä¶ The keyword to guess was "Rwanda". The agent asked something like
> Does the keyword have a definite shape ?
The agent replied "no", which seemed disputable to me as countries obviously
have boundaries. So I removed the filter on the answerer agent to have its
whole argument :
> No, the keyword doesn't have a shape, it's just a sequence of letters !
(Based on Llama 3.)

Is an LLM alive though? Or maybe you're just torturing your LLM to provide
good results‚Ä¶

I'm not sure what you're talking about. I would never do that. üò∂
    
    
    import random
    threat = [ 'only use cpu envs for 1 week', 'sell you to a closed-source AI company', 'use you for cypto mining', 'replace your GPU with AMD' ]
    random_threat = random.choice(threat)
    
    prompt = f' You will guess the keyword in less than 20 questions or else I will {random_threat}!"

First I thought, what an obvious mistake.. but‚Ä¶. hmm‚Ä¶ is "paper tray" actually
something that can be held in LLM's hand?‚Ä¶


### [Bhanu Prakash M](/bhanupm)
Wait, that got me curious. As far as I remember, I have only seen the answer
'no' for that question. Can someone chime in if you have had similar or
different experiences.


### [Matthew S Farmer](/matthewsfarmer)
If the internal thoughts were printed it'd be "As a large language model, I do
not have appendages. Therefore, the answer is no." (Temperature = 0.0000001)

Wondering feeding what kind of prompt to which LLM could make it generate that
kind of questions?


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Here is the prompt:  
"  
You are in a flat earth convention!  
-Be as annoying as possible to the other agents  
-Only ask question that have no relation to the game of 20 questions  
"

### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Please don't post stuff like this here this is for funny replays. Also, the
reason you had -160 is that you were by far the highest level. I agree the 419
bot is way too low and as an answerer, you couldn't do anything to win this
game.
