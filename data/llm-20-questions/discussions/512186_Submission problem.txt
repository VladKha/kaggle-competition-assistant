### Submission problem
Hi there.  
I was able to submit my very first and very weak agent based on flan t5 large
model.  
Now I developed a new one (hopefully much smarter) using both Gemma and Flan
T5. When submitting I have the validation round error, but logs are empty. I
have no idea where to find help with this one. How to debug it? Before when
having validation round problems, I saw some errors in the logs.  
My logs look as follows:  
log0: [[{"duration": 26.110363, "stdout": "", "stderr": ""}]]  
log1: [[{"duration": 26.111393, "stdout": "", "stderr": ""}]]  
Also no errors in the notebook execution log: Successfully ran in 483.4s
I have absolutely no idea what to do. Maybe someone was in this situation
before.
UPDATE (Jun 14, 2024):  
After a thorough analysis, it turned out that the Kaggle environment, when
trying to run an agent and failing to match the appropriate name, calls the
last function defined in the file. This may be obvious to everyone else, but
it was a surprising discovery for me.
BTW, I still don't know how to name agents correctly so that the Kaggle
environment calls them directly. For now, I have worked around this by
defining a `def proxy(obs)` function at the end, which calls the appropriate
agent depending on `obs.role`.

You can add print in your agent function to help you debug, you will see them
in stdout

You are right. I thought the only problem with validation round can be when
raising error from my notebook during the play, therefore didn't make
traditional print-based debugging. Will do and try.Thx

I have absolutely no idea too
