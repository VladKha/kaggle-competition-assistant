### Chris crossed 900 Mark 🤯
Seems like he is playing with the bots himself 😂. Always a fan of his thought
process. Waiting for him to drop us some hints on the technique he is using.

Also one more thing his "highly secret" technique is an almost hardcoded LLM
mix of which most of the top places use. He starts off by finding if the
keyword is country, city, or landmark, then finds the location of the keyword
(Europe, Asia, Americas) and then asks for the first letter of keywkeyword.
For example, my strategy tarts just like his but instead of first letter
searching I hand it to my model to fully decide what to question next.  
No hate to Chris but I highly doubt this is because of some crazy new model or
agent change.  
This competition also recently changed the metric and it adds about 130
instead of about 60 prevously.

Don't mean to be a party pooper but this doesn't mean much if an agent gets 2
or 3 lucky games in a row it will cement itself at the top for a long time. I
am not saying he didn't invent a new strategy but from the agent logs his
strategy s the exact same. Of course, he could have made his answerer better
or something but the games that his score increased in was him as a
questioner. So this does not mean much from what I see his strategy s the same
he just got lucky.

what does that even mean
