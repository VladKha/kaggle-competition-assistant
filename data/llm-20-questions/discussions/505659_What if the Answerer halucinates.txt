### What if the Answerer halucinates
Hello everyone, I am not sure if I understood everything about the evaluation,
but it seems to me that the one who will be answering the questions is also a
LLM, so I was wandering, what if the LLM that answers the questions give the
wrong answer? In that case the other LLM will not be able to get the right
secret word. Is there something in the evaluation that penalize the LLM in
this case? Is there a way to know if the LLM answered the question wrong?

The penalty is that you are less likely to win the game. You will drop in the
rankings and get paired with bad models

but, is it the penalty for the bad answerer or the model playing against it?
Because you can have a model that is good at making questions and finding the
secret word, but the answer to questions is not really good as the idea is to
have two different models, one for questions and finding the model and other
to answer to questions, correct?

Each submission has a ranking that changes after each match. An agent that
often responds incorrectly will most likely never win a match (and thus
consistently drop in rating).
Yes, for that match the model paired with the bad answerer will also lose
rating for that game, but can go on to gain rating with other partners in
other matches.
Note that since you are matched with agents around your skill level, this
becomes less of a problem the higher in the leaderboard you go.

Yes, then that team is doomed, the answerer LLM as well. It is a cooperative
2v2, you have to get lucky with teammates I guess.
