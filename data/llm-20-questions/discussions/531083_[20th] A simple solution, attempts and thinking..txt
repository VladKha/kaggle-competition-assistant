### [20th] A simple solution, attempts and thinking.
Since I joined this competition at the last week, so I just tried some simple
approaches.
# result
  * agent 1 score 1006
  * agent 2 score 934
# Initial idea : Semantic binary search
I use gpt-4o and deepseek-chat as the policy agent, build multiple semantic
trees based on the public keywords. I seems work good on the powerful models,
but the challenge is the paired answer model is random â€¦
Then I did some experiments on the open source models, such as llama3/3.1,
qwen and their variants. but the results are depressed, the response
consistency to gpt-4o and deepseek is only 70%~80%, which is likely to lead in
the wrong direction after multiple rounds of questioning.
# Final approach


## Agent Alpha
After that, I only have two days left. So I tried to borrow some ideas from
commulity and came across AgentAlpha. It has a much higher win rate compared
to any LLM based approaches, but it also requires a significant number of
kaggler to choose it. Any way, It only took one round to shake hand, so I
think it is a good deal. Then I used deepseek-chat (much cheaper than gpt-4o)
to generate 30K similar keywords based on the public keywords as the keywords
pool of agent alpha.


## pre-defined questions and CoT-SC
When Agent Alpha is unavailable, I use a pre-defined quesiton seuqences first
( from initial idea) , and then lever a CoT-SC Agent (Self-Consistency Chain-
of-Thought Agent ) to generate questions.
There is still a lot of optimization that can be done, such as expanding the
keywords list using WIKI or other knowledge bases, or do some filtering, and
using vllm to accelerate the model for more thorough reasoning and voting. Due
to the speed, there is no CoT then guessing word â€¦
Thanks to Kaggle for hosting this competition. It was fun, and I'm looking
forward to more competitions like this in the furture.

I think my approach might not be very strong but lucky ðŸ˜‚
