I couldn't figure out from instructions about which submissions will be
selected as final entries. Do only active submissions get selected as final
entries or do we get to choose in the end out of all submissions? Given the
discrepancies in scoring, it is kinda hard to choose an entry but it would be
nice to at least select experiments that scored well in the past!


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Good question. I think it will only be active which are our last 3
submissions.


### [Matthew S Farmer](/matthewsfarmer)
I made two identical submissions at the same time a few weeks back. 200 point
disparity.

It seems to be who you happen to get partnered with. If you happen to get
paired with a no agent or a yes agent or gives very poor answers as the
questioner you have no chance.
Or if you are a good answerer and get partnered with a great question model
you can shoot up in the rankings.


### [TuMinhDang](/darkswordmg)
I see that some articles have somewhat strange answers to questions. it seems
to be in a constant draw. and I still don't understand why it says auto answer
no.


### [Ioannis M](/imeintanis)
Interesting fact! All 3 agents have played the same number of games with the
same opponents?
1) does this hold true for any simulation competition, e.g. Rock, papers,
scissors etc?  
2) has to do with the number of games/opponents played?  
3) Is there a way to calculate mathematically min/upper bounds ?  
4) from your experience what percentage of "luck" you'd say is involved in
such competition?


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Interesting. Thanks for sharing.
