Has anyone succeeded in using new Gemma 2 (it was just released today) for
this competition?

I couldn't run it due to a GPU memory error.  
So, I downloaded the LLM locally as shown in [this
code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kasafumi/gemma2-9b-it-llm20-questions), and
it worked in my test environment.  
However, creating the submit file would exceed the capacity of the output
directory, so i could not submit.

I've been trying to use Gemma 2 as well. I downloaded your notebook's output
and compressed it on my computer, then submitted the compressed file but it
didn't pass validation (the logs were empty). Do you have any idea why that
could be or how to change the code so that main.py runs only on the files in
/submission? I'm new to this so any help is appreciated.
