### Can't download submission tar
Nothing happens when I click download on the submission tar file. Smaller
main.py downloads fine. But nothing happens when I try to download the big
tarball…
What gives?

Just had to wait. All of the sudden it started, having being downloaded in the
background without any progress bar.. Bad UX
