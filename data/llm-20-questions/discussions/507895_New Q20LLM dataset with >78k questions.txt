### New Q20LLM dataset with >78k questions
Hi, recently on [Mistral AI
hackathon](https://x.com/MistralAILabs/status/1788970688172245256) I've build
a new dataset [Q20LLM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cvmistralparis/Q20LLM)
using provided APIs from [Mistral API](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/) and [Groq
Cloud](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/).
AFAIK there is no dataset with dialog questions from general to specific. I
tried to build such dialogs with LLMs. I also tried to fine-tune "instruction
following" model on this dataset, but no success. The model tends to ask as
many questions as it saw during training.
