### Will late submissions be possible?
I would very much like to review this competition and would like to make a
LATE SUBMISSION.  
However, when I tried to do a submission now, it was not possible, as shown in
the attached image. It may be that the scoring is running out of computing
resources, but will I be able to do submissions again later on?

Unfortunately late submissions will not be possible. We'll shut down the
cluster of machines we've used to run this competition after the final scoring
is complete. Keep an eye out and we may have another LLM competition in the
future though!


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
My guess is no because that would require Kaggle to continually run
simulations which would deplete their compute resources. If we look at old
simulation competitions like "Rock Paper Scissors"
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rock-paper-scissors), they did not
allow late submissions.


### [Mahmoud Elshahed](/letemoin)
I Don't think agents or late submission, may be open until they finalize the
leaderboard and complete evaluation period at end of August.


### [Krupal Patel](/krupalpatel07)
yes, it will possible.
