### How is the score calculated?
I was looking through some episodes and in some, I see massive changes in the
score up to +64 and -64 but in some, I see stuff like +0 +1 +4 etc. I was
wondering how this is calculated. Thank you for the help!

The evaluation page says:
> Each submission has an estimated skill rating which is modeled by a Gaussian
> N(μ,σ2) where μ is the estimated skill and σ represents the uncertainty of
> that estimate which will decrease over time.

> When you upload a submission, we first play a validation episode where that

> the agent logs to help figure out why. Otherwise, we initialize the
> submission with μ0=600 and it joins the pool of for ongoing evaluation.
I have noticed that a true win or loss changes score more than a tie (i.e. no
team gets a correct answer).
