As mentioned in [competition
update](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/523198),
**all "locations" will be removed** , and there will be only "things"
keywords.
On **Aug 6** , [This was **confirmed to be done** here with the host's
reply](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/523198#2948233).
Therefore, it is natural for competitors to remove all "locations" Q&A in
their logics.
However, as of **Aug 9** , [ (opens in a new tab)">my agent still **compete in
the game with keyword
"Australia"**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/submissions?dialog=episodes-
episode-55669669), and unavoidbly lost.
So, to repeat myself, this post just want to ensure that the host know this
issue, and I hope this will be 100% fix in the evaluation period.

It's so weird. I think the office should give some feedback.
