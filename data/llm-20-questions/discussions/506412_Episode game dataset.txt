### Episode game dataset
Hello,
The json replay files that can be download from the leaderboaed are not very
readable. It contains observation for each 6 agents ( 'ask', 'guess', 'answer'
* 2 teams) for each rounds (up to 20), so there is a lot of duplicate.  
I made a notebook to format them into a lighter dataframe and save it a csv
for later use. Using the meta kaggle dataset to get all game played, updated
daily

I think it can be useful
