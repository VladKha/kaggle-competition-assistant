### I am still confused about scorring
My understanding that questioner and answerer works together. If they guess
the word they will get points so i would assume if they dont work nicely both
gets negative reward.

Your change in points depends on the scores of your teammate and opponents.
Before game started, you had 659, Learning Curve had 599, Raki had 603, and
Lathashree had 594. Afterward you all tied. So all scores move toward the
average of the 4 teams. This means your score decreases while the other 3
increase.
Here is a approximate summary:
  * If you tie with teams scored lower than yourself, your score decrease
  * If you tie with teams scored higher than yourself, your score increase
  * If you win, your score increase
  * If you lose, your score decrease.

Here is quote from evaluation page
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/overview/evaluation)
> Ranking System  
>  After an episode finishes, we'll update the rating estimate for all bots in
> the episode. If one bot pair won, we'll increase their μ and decrease the
> opponent's μ -- if the result was a tie, then we'll move the μ values closer
> towards their mean. The updates will have magnitude relative to the
> deviation from the expected result based on the previous μ values, and also
> relative to each bot’s uncertainty σ. We also reduce the σ terms relative to
> the amount of information gained by the result. The score by which your bot
> wins or loses an episode does not affect the skill rating updates.
