### Keyword list for post-comp games
Can we get the confirmation from competition hosts that the keywords used now
(those in keywords.py and those sampled from hidden set) will not be reused in
post-comp games? I have seen some posts talking about this but just want to
confirm this fact. Thank you!

I am posting this post because there are datasets of scraped hidden keywords
from current lb. Want to make sure they will **NOT** be included in post-comp
games.
