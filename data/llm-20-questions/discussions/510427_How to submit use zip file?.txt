### How to submit use zip file?
Hi, all. I want to submit my agent through a zip file. Here is my file
structure:
    
    
    ├── lib
    ├── main.py
    ├── models
    
    
    content_copy
I uploaded through `kaggle competitions submit -c llm-20-questions -f
submission.zip -m "debug-file-upload"`. But the agent check failed and the log
from agent-1 and 2 are both empty, and there is no replay. It seems that I
somehow put the `main.py` in the wrong place?
I'm wondering how will this zip file be processed after uploading. Where will
it be put and how will it be decompressed? Should I include a `submission/`
subdir for the zip file?

During submit, your zip will be uncompressed to folder
"/kaggle_simulations/agent/", so you must add this to system path so that your
code can find your models. Add the following code to the beginning of your
`main.py`:
    
    
    KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH = "/kaggle_simulations/agent/"
    if os.path.exists(KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH):
        sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH, 'lib'))
    else:
        sys.path.insert(0, "/kaggle/working/submission/lib")
    
    
    content_copy

Thanks for your reply! I know about this, and I indeed have code like this.
Moreover, I can submit successfully with the Starter Notebook after I copy all
of my `main.py`, paste it to the corresponding position in the Starter
Notebook, and submit the notebook. But somehow when I'm uploading the zip file
it doesn't work (and without error message).


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
ok then maybe there is another error.
If your code fails the validation game (where your bot plays against your
bot), there is a button to download logs. If you download logs, you will see
the specific error message.
Also you can use print statements inside your main.py file and print debugging
info. These print statements will show up in your logs.


### [sakura](/isalreadytoken)
Thanks, it is strange that the agent log is empty. I will try to print more
debug message then.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Sounds good. And just so others can find it, here is how to find the
validation logs:

### [sakura](/isalreadytoken)
Thanks again. Unrelated to this question, I have another question about this
challenge. Could you help me with this?

can you try tar.gz instead of zip?


### [sakura](/isalreadytoken)
Update: this my structure use unzip command:
    
    
    unzip -l example.zip | awk -F/ 'NF<=3'
    
    
    content_copy
