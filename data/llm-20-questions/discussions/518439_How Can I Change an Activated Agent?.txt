### How Can I Change an Activated Agent?
Hello, I submitted an incorrect Agent. Due to a poorly written prompt, this
Agent repeatedly causes [Err]. I want to remove this Agent, but I cannot find
a button to delete the Agent in the Submission tab. What should I do? Please
help.

There is no way to remove or choose the agent to use. However, if you want to
remove an incorrect agent you can submit the new one 3 times to wipe the
incorrect one out of the 3 agents counted.

Thank you for your response. I am aware of that method, but I think it is not
a very cool approach. My other agents are working well, but having to start
from 600 points again because of an agent I uploaded by mistake seems like a
loss to me.

Yes, this is aggravating but I believe the Kaggle team did this to stop people
from enabling previous agents for a high spot on the leaderboard.
