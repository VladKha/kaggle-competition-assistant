### Convergence of leaderboard scores
I don't understand, how can I go from 1st, down to 36th, back up to 1st, and
down to 94th on the leaderboard?  
Are you guys sure this will converge to a stable score for all players?
Because if not it will be quite arbitrary who wins and be based on timing.

In looking through the current matches, most of the submissions seem to be
random experiments. I'd guess:
  * we will see a lot more convergence as agents with more skill start to consistently win matches
  * part of the convergence will be fake as some agents are optimized on the public keywords
  * after August 13th, the agents at top of the leaderboard that are optimized on the public keywords will drop off and a new set of agents will converge to the top of the leaderboard

I also feel the same. Here the luck is dependent on person, place and thing ðŸ˜‚


### [VolodymyrBilyachat](/vovikdrg)
Yes and some agents seems to take return default yes or no all the time :D


### [Giba](/titericz)
Current LB looks like a periodic random shuffle. There are many broken agents
all around which makes impossible to have a stable LB.


### [Giba](/titericz)
Also watching some replays is possible to get +40 to +100 LB points just
because one opponent agent returns error.
