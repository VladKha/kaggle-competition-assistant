### Does It Make Sense To Join The Competition Late?
Given the nature of this competition, **does it even make sense to enter late,
say in a month or two?**
Because more battles means potentially more points. "Older" bots are also way
more likely to win, given that they've been fine-tuned and adjusted more.
I've read in the overview that newer bots will be paired "more often than
older bots", but does this negate the lost time?
Joining any competition late has it's up- and downsides of course, but this
one feels way more downsided. **Anyone has some experience with this?**

[@kevinbnisch](https://www.kaggle.com/kevinbnisch) after the submission
deadline we will continue to run matches until we see that agents are around
their final rating. Let me know if that answers your question!

Hi TheItCrow,  
My loser opinion. Join it and make something Public. That's how we'll be
remembered: Public work.  
After some time, No one knows who won the competition. EVEN in LIFE. Except
those on prize/money zone matters.  
Therefore, leave your mark. I've already left my shitful stuff.  
Besides, you have quality knowledge to deliver. Bring it on! Users can learn
with your worthy job.  
Make up your mind, in a month or two it'll still matter .

That's inspiring. I'm always on the fence about joining competitions due to my
background


### [hengck23](/hengck23)
my advise is : just join if you like it.  
you may not win, but you are sure to have lots of fun and learn new things â€¦
and that could be the most important.

Why not? It might seem like a waste of time, but the experience gained from
participating in the competition is usually valuable.

Depends on your goals.
If your goal is to learn and have fun, then always join, even after the
competition has ended a year before and you just discovered it.
If your goal is to win, join anytime as the hosts state that newer bots will
be matched more frequently than older bots to diminish the impact of this
variable of entry date.

You will have different bots some better that the other, so each good one you
submit will alert your opponent and force them to enhance their bot.
A nice strategy may be to submit a punch of bots but keep your secret salsa
near the end ðŸ˜‰

Doesn't matter when you join. The bots will be ran against each other all over
again from the start after the deadline.
