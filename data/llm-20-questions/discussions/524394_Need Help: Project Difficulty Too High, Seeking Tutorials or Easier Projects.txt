### Need Help: Project Difficulty Too High, Seeking Tutorials or Easier
Projects
Hi everyone,  
I'm currently working on the competition, and I find the difficulty level
quite overwhelming. I've been struggling to make significant progress and
would greatly appreciate any assistance or guidance.  
Could anyone recommend some useful tutorials or resources that could help me
understand the necessary concepts better? Alternatively, if there are any
similar projects or competitions with a lower difficulty level, I would love
to try those first to build up my skills.  
Thanks in advance for your help!
