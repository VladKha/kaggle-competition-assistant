### Submission Failed: Previously Successful File Fails Sporadically
My previously successful submission has now failed. I am unable to check the
error logs(404).
Only two agents are displayed.
I submitted the same file five times, and it failed only once.
Does anyone have any clues or suggestions?

I'm having issues now on code I didn't have an issue with in past… This is
very strange. No errors in the output. But the game replay shows "none" for my
answerer agent. Unless I am missing something, this is not possible. I use a
try-conditional answerer with a fall-back answer if there is an error and if
there is an error, it is printed to stderr. There is no error messages and the
output is none… I am at a loss.

Same weird error for me. Not sure if this is because of the competition or
not, but if this doesn't fix quickly the end of this competition could be
destroyed.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
I think same issue here, hard to tell the cause, and what else to do than just
try again..


### [ISAKA Tsuyoshi](/isakatsuyoshi)
I agree, it seems like a random system error that occurred. It's frustrating
not being able to see the logs.


### [Andrew Tratz](/jademonk)
Having a similar issue - failing with 404 error when clicking on logs. Is this
still happening frequently for you?


### [ISAKA Tsuyoshi](/isakatsuyoshi)
Thank you for your comment! It's the same phenomenon. Although not frequent,
I've experienced it twice.
