### Size of the LLM
Hello,  
I have a question on choosing the model,  
Is there any restriction on choosing a model (<=7B parameters)? or can I
choose a model which is much larger?

Competitors have to run their model on a NVIDIA T4 (16GB). In practice using
the bitsandbyte pip package a 7B param model is about the largest anyone has
been able to run.
