[JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou) ¬∑ 197th in this Competition ¬∑ Posted 8 days ago


### There is no safe place on the leaderboard!
  1. I don't use Agent alpha, my agent actually responds "no" to the question "is it Agent alpha" which is unfortunate because it can, in principle, answer agent alpha's questions
  2. Before the confidence reset I was in the top-20's!
  3. After confidence reset, I dropped to 400+ in less than 24h. This is because I competed with the agent alphas
  4. My two agents are fighting for resurrection. It is hard! The dead won't let them come back alive.
  5. One agent managed to win a game, came back in top-200. But this only lasted 24h. Both agents are dead again.
  * So my conclusion, it is hard to be in top-20's as a non-alpha agent. It is even harder to remain in the middle, very unstable agents there. At the bottom, you don't want to know what is happening there.
  * Your thoughts?

I'm hopeful there's an additional LLM-focused competition soon. Pushing LLM
capabilities to thier max within a contained environment was a great learning
experience. I learned much from experimenting with different models,
techniques, and learning from others.  
There's almost no chance my agent will reach the top 10% versus alpha/search
bots BUT I am thankful for what I learned. That's enough for me!  
Looking forward to seeing y'all in other comps. ‚úåÔ∏è


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
Maybe we should have implemented alphabetical ordering in addition to our own
approach


### [Matthew S Farmer](/matthewsfarmer)
That wouldn't have been a beneficial learning experience for me. In my
research, I am using small language models to create emergent ontologies for
clinical applications on unstructured text. Pushing LLMs to their limit
without a verbose reference list aligns with my path. Unfortunately for me,
that means low placement on the leaderboard, but I'm still pleased with the
knowledge gained. Bonus: it did, in fact, help in my research activities.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
That's great..


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
It's all correct and little hope is left unless your agents have a streak of
3-4 wins while still having high sigma‚Ä¶ Actually, there's a movie kinda about
the pit and your situation -- The Platform (2019), very recommendable. Hang on
amigo!


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
The decrease of sigma seems magical. Agents that go from top20 to 400+ should
still have a high sigma. But it seems it is not the case


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
It's not magical to me anymore, I've read a bit about the algorithm.


### [Sadhaklal](/sambitmukherjee)
Same here. Sudden & huge drop after confidence reset‚Ä¶


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
5 days left though, anything can happen. One might still win a bronze medal


### [Aravind S](/aravind36)
It's like hoping/praying not to get paired with Agent Alpha or face teams
using Agent Alpha.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
Lots of rollercoasters at the top of the leaderboard.


### [yuanzhe zhou](/yuanzhezhou)
Now my agent almost stopped playing


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
This happens from time to time.
