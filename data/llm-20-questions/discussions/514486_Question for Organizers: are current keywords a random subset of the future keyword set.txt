### Question for Organizers: are current keywords a random subset of the
future keyword set
You mentioned that the keywords have already been updated, and that the new
keywords would be representative of the future final keyword list.
Is it safe to assume that the current keywords were selected as a random
subset of the final keyword list? Or will the current keywords be extended in
a different way?

With the new hidden word set I can say we are much closer to the final keyword
list. We'd prefer as few as possible changes for the longest amount of time,
but need to keep options open if we need to take action to ensure
competitiveness.

[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) Thank you! My question slightly
different. It was how the current keyword list was obtained from the full
future keyword list.
I could imagine at least four possible situations:
**1\. Situation 1: Random sampling**  
You had a full list of keywords for the future final validation you you
randlomly sampled 1000 keywords from it to make the currently used list of
keywords.  
_It means we can assume that ratio of different groups (countries, cities,
mountains, rivers, houshold items, etc) in the final keyword list will be the
same as in the currently used 1000 keywords._
**2\. Situation 2: Random sampling from different groups**  
You had a full list of keywords for the future final validation as a list of
groups (countries, cities, mountains, rivers, houshold items, etc) and you
randomly sampled some amoung from each group to get the currently used 1000
keywords.  
_It means we can assume that all main groups that will be used in the final
keyword list are represented in the current used 1000 keywords but their ratio
can be different._
**3\. Situation 3: Taking some groups**  
You had a full list of keywords for the future final validation as a list of
groups (countries, cities, mountains, rivers, houshold items, etc) and you
took come of those groups to get the currently used 1000 keywords.  
_It means that groups used in the current keyword list will be taken as it for
the future final keyword list but some new groups can be added._
**4\. Situation 4: Soemthing else**
Thank you for answering, this information is indeed critically important to
design any reasonable solution.

I'm assuming the final keyword set will be wordnet for the final eval ðŸ«
