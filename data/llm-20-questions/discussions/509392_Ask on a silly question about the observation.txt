### Ask on a silly question about the observation
I have read the code in llm_20_questions.py. I have noticed that many objects
like active, and inactive has not been explained very clearly.  
I am wondering where I can see the methods of the objects like obs…  
obs.turnType, obs. question etc….

throwing a `print(dir(obs))` in and running with debug mode should show you
everything in there!
