### Is 3 the max number of agents you can have?
I was wondering why the highest number of agents on the leaderboard I saw was
only 3. What happens if I submit 4 models? Do I have to choose 3 of them to
compete? Thanks in advance!

It looks like only your most recent 3 submissions contribute to your LB score.
So if you have 3 and submit 1 more. Then your first (out of the original 3)
stops counting toward your LB score (and instead your newest i.e. 4th sub
begins counting).

Can you choose which ones to use or is it the 3 newest?


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
I cannot figure out how to choose. So for me, it is my most recent 3.

Ok thanks for the help!
