### 'Location' still exists in the keywords
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard)  
In my recent failure(EpisodeId:55914594), 'Austria' was chosen as the keyword,
and my teammate had clearly received the prior knowledge that the keyword
could only be a 'thing'. Meanwhile, the opponent asked midway if the keyword
was a type of location, so we inevitably lost.  
Therefore, I hope that the result of this episode can be disregarded.

Otherwise I would very likely miss out on my first 🥉.🥺

15 hours left to end competition, we can't do anything now. I'm praying for my
silver 😂

I tried my best, and now all we need is 🙏🙏🙏

Yeah, there are non-thing keywords… (I noticed "Ohio" being used, so there
could be more of them)  
I really wish that host took a more careful look into the keyword list rather
than taking time to adjust the "confidence".  
Having the right keyword list is more important than having the right
"confidence" in my opinion.
BTW: Changing the confidence has led my bot to drop from gold to bronze medal.
Sad… :(  
I really hope the HOST does not make ANY changes after the final submission
deadline, except for fixing bugs or mistakes like an incorrect keyword list.

Not to mention that the host has been _repeatedly_ warned of the scoring's
shortcomings, by _many_ people, and had plenty of time to consider
alternatives _before_ the submission deadline…

Another confidence restart and 1 day extend would be great! 🥹

I wouldn't mind running it all over again, with proper fixes and parameters,
fully on schedule from start to finish just 1 week… but otherwise it's not
easy to cope with such a rollercoaster..

[@ariocx](https://www.kaggle.com/ariocx) sorry about this 😅, indeed my agent
only fine-tuned on "things" keywords. I wonder what
[@paulpawletta](https://www.kaggle.com/paulpawletta) used for questioner?
