### Open source models from hugging face or Groq
Hi ,  
Is it possible to use models hosted in hugging face / groq, via an api call,
as i am facing lot of issues to create a langchain based agent wrapper for the
local llm?

The evaluation environment does not access the internet. Model weights must be
loaded into submission. Therefore, an API call that relies on an internet
connection would not work. Models on HF can be used, but you need to either
download the snapshot and upload or use the save pretrained function within
the transformers library. Since groq would rely on an internet connection, it
would not work.
