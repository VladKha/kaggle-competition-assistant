### Clarification on LLM Usage and Constraints
Can anyone confirm if we are permitted to use any LLM, provided it operates
within the specified time and memory constraints? Additionally, are we allowed
to use closed-source models, such as the GPT-4 API?

Yes, we can use any model. However during submit we do not have access to
internet, so we cannot use GPT-4 but rather must upload a model's saved
weights for submission. Furthermore since we are limited to 16GB VRAM and
100GB disk, we can only submit small LLM models.

Thank you for the clarification!
