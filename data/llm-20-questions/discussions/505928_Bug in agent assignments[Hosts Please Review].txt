### Bug in agent assignments[Hosts Please Review]
I decided to start a new discussion thread to get some eyes on this.
[@robikscube](https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube) mentioned this in another
thread:

You can see his post here:

I noticed the same thing in the code but ignored it as further down in the
same script those variables are assigned using methods defined above them:
>

Am I missing something? It does look like a bug when they are assigned the
same value at the beginning of the code but then further down they appear to
be assigned new appropriate values.
Hosts could you please confirm this is not causing an issue?
