### Help with loading model into kaggle environments
Hey all,  
I've tried way too many times to save a model locally and get it to be
accepted during the validation phase after submission. Any tips?  
Model, weights, tokenizer are all part of the submission tarball along with my
submission file but I continue to fail validation. I've already been using
Gemma as shown in the started notebook but I would like to try other LLMs.
I've loaded HF snapshots, cloned git repos, copied steps from public code, but
no luck.  
Is there documentation about the kaggle game environment that I'm missing?  
Thanks for any assistance.  
Cheers!

maybe show part of your code for loading?
