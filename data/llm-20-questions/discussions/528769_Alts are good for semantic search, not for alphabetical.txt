### Alts are good for semantic search, not for alphabetical
I was expecting the unexpected and that's why one of my agents is not alpha.
But what could go wrong for alpha?
Communication channel distortion? Even an extra space in front, a single
letter swap could break alpha search completely. Although this would involve
changing the evaluation code on purpose, which would be highly controversial.
Another thing that I thought might be applied would be alts. More alts,
especially alts with different spelling, starting with a different letter
would give LLMs advantage. In natural settings, when someone guesses "computer
screen" it counts just as "monitor". Actually ChatGPT gives many more:
    
    
    Here are some synonyms and alternative terms for "computer screen":
    
    Monitor
    Display
    Visual display unit (VDU)
    Screen
    LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)
    LED (Light Emitting Diode) display
    Computer display
    Display screen
    Computer monitor
    Visual monitor
    
    
    content_copy
Maybe not all are on spot, but putting them to alts would give a huge boost to
semantic search, while alpha would be forced to search for just the main
keyword.
I have a specific example of this from my agent, which didn't play alpha in
this episode (even though this particular question is about the first letter
it was mainly a semantic search):

So I think it's a missed opportunity that alts were not used to boost semantic
search, after all I doubt anybody wanted to see such a domination.

I had quite similar when word was dvd collection and my bot was hummering
around cd collection ðŸ˜…

Welp for one thing I'd say alts are not reliable/thorough enough, because we
could approach the same semantic search from multiple angles and can only hope
there would be an alt to catch what the guesser is trying to guess.
For example look at the instance shown
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/528200)
.  
Finally I'd like to add that although alts favor semantic search, it still is
not reliable enough compared to the binary search (given you have the keyword
beforehand). But still, you bring up a good point.
