### Award a prize or gold to the best non alpha agent
Unless some magic happens, it is no longer a secret that alpha agents will win
the competition. However, there a lot of good agents out there.
  * Would it make sens to award a prize to the best overall non alpha agent?
  * In addition, award a gold medal to the top-10 non-alpha agents

What you are suggesting is very dangerous. One could easily argue that awards
from all competitions should be divided manually by all strategies (including
not optimal ones). Its like suggesting giving medals to athletes that do not
win the game in Olympics simply because "they also tried hard"


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
Not really. There are agents in top50 that do not use alpha agent. So they are
doing quite good, it is not just about trying hard
