### At exactly what time the competition will end?
Should it be at the default time as usual for all Kaggle competition?  
23:59:59 2024-08-29 UTC?  
If so, will [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) or Kaggle stop all games
at the exact time?

Good luck Kha Vo! I am hoping that you win solo gold and become Kaggle
Competition Grandmaster!


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Thanks Chris. Such a pleasure to see your bless. I also hope that comes true.
I’ve had good memories and learned new things here, so in case I couldn’t make
it I’ll get that as extra motivation and come back stronger very soon.

I'm assuming that they will stop at the above time and any games in progress
won't count (similar to code competitions). I think the stop time is 23:59:00
though.
