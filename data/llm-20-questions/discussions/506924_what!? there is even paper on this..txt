Kinda like Akinator

I love how LLM's have their own unique world for performance metrics. About to
give this contest, really excited ðŸ˜Š

I believe key is in changing the questions from 'it' to the obs.keyword before
asking the LLM the yes/no question in the game as would be interpreted by
anyone answering. If there is no it or keyword and the question is something
like is the grass green? the answer should be no :) but if asked directly to
the LLM the answer will be yes.
