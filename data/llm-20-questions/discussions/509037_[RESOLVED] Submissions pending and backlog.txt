### [RESOLVED] Submissions pending and backlog
Our servers went down for a few hours, during which we continued to schedule
matches (which were subsequently queued). Servers are now back online, but we
have about 2k matches to play through. I estimate this will take 12-18 hours
to complete (I'll post once that happens).
Until we are caught back up:
  1. submissions will take a long while to process
  2. you'll see matches queue for a long time
  3. new submissions will have very few matches
I'll update here once we have caught up!
EDIT: This has been resolved and submissions and matches should be processing
as normal now. Thanks!
