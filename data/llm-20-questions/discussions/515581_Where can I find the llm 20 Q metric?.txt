### Where can I find the llm 20 Q metric?
Basically, the title wanted to be able to test my models. 😁

The "metric" is how our overall LB increases which uses a formula based on
number of games we have previously played. However during validation I do not
think we can use this.
For validation, I think we just want `accuracy` and `speed of win`. In other
words optimize our models to correctly guess word in 20 questions and guess in
the fewest number of guesses (i.e << 20)

Ok, Thank you!

Sorry but this is not what I meant I wanted to know if I could find how the
zipped models are played against eachother
