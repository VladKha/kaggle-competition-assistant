### How can I use the latest version of the transformers library in the
production environment?
Dear Kaggle Staff
The latest transformers library (ver 4.42.4) installed via pip in the Kaggle
environment is being downgraded to ver 4.41.2 in the production environment
and is not being reflected properly.
Could you please advise on the best way to use the latest transformers library
in the production environment ?

Our team is experiencing the same issue. The old version of the transformers
library is taking precedence over the newer one we installed during the build.

You can view my starter notebook to learn how to pip install packages to be
used during submission [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/starter-

I've tried using this setup but I'm running Gemma 2. I followed the same steps
as in the notebook (changing sys.path etc), but when importing transformers in
the production environment I get the older version too so it can't load Gemma
2. I think your main doesn't need transformers 4.42.4 so it runs fine, but
correct me if I'm wrong.
