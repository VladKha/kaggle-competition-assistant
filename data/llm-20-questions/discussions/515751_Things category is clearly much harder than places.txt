### Things category is clearly much harder than places
Given that these keywords are equally split. You'd be much better off focusing
on building a bot that just get's every country or city right.
How is an LLM going to guess any of these??  
iv, fire escape ladder, guard tower, kale smoothie, stained glass window (why
does it have to be stained??), turn signal (an unbelievably specific component
of a car), soap suds (what are these??), finger food, cooling tower, coffee
makers (??), stair stepper

Found the new hardest keywordâ€¦

Why does it have to be stationary? Technically stationary is an adjective and
20 questions is about objects. For example a "dog"; however, in this
competition instead of "dog" the keyword would probably be "mainly white but
slightly brown-spotted furry large and happy jumping chihuahua" ðŸ˜‚  
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) are the adjectives before the objects
added on purpose or is this one an accident? Also, will the private LB
keywords be like this?
EDIT: I can't take it anymore

To be fair, â€˜Stationary Bikeâ€™ is its own thing used to workout indoors the
difference is pretty significant. â€˜Survey Markerâ€™ is pretty ridiculous though.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
True, but it is almost as if the kaggle team has a list of adjectives and a
list of nouns and are randomly just choosing two of them to go together.


### [Van Mason](/vanmason)
My favorite is aquarium salt. How is a human supposed to guess that in 20
questions let alone a LLM?


### [RS Turley](/rturley)
For hardest "thing" to guess from the current word list, I'd nominate "cypress
knees." I couldn't believe it when I saw that one pop up.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
I got "ice bin" what even is that a cooler??? I am also getting more stupid
things like "dead leaf" than actually useful objects.
EDIT: Why are some things in plural?

I think so too. It's difficult to win the game when a 'things' keyword comes
up. As you mentioned, it seems like a better strategy to develop an LLM that
excels at identifying 'place' keywords. I believe that 'things' keywords are
more likely to result in a draw anyway.
