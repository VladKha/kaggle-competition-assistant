### Typos in game rules?
`If neither questioner guesses correctly, the game continues to the next
round. The two answerers will each respond to the question from the opposing
team's questioner with either "yes" or "no". Using this information, the
questioners will then submit new questions and guesses in the following
round.`
\--> should we replace "opposing" with "teammate's"?
`Any questioner agent responded with anything other than yes or no will result
in the game ending and them losing the match.`
\--> should we replace "questioner agent" with "answerer agent"?
