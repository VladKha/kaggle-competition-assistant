### Is there any way to locally simulate a 20 questions game to test new
ideas?
I just wanted to know if I could locally run model because I was having too
many bugs with an agent and wanted to test new ideas locally.

Yes. Try this: <https://www.kaggle.com/code/rturley/run-debug-

Errors on submission may result from other causes, I too struggle with
submissions, even though notebooks work perfectly and the evaluation on
submission is initially successful, they fail during the self-play and there
are not many clues to figure out.
