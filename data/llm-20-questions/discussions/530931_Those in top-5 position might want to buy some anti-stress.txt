### Those in top-5 position might want to buy some anti-stress

### Big competition coming to an end. It has been exciting, but at the same
time, frustrating. I won't mention the frustration part here though. I keep
the positive side of it all. The main topic is below.
  * I wouldn't like to be in top-5 right now; even worse, in top-3.
  * The leaderboard keeps applying a reshuffling operation. With a blink of an eye, one can go from 1st to 3rd.
  * Unfortunately there is nothing to do about it now. 
  * If I were among the top-3, I would either stop visiting the leaderboard, or take some anti-stress.
Good luck to all. And to the top-5, please take care of your heart!

Good advice! I don't mean to jinx, but the top3 looks quite safe, if only
everything goes as normal.. but right under is a scary situation indeed…

Yeah it's crazy, in the last 3 days my team climbed from 13th place to 2nd
place down to 10th up to 5th again and now again at 10th!
