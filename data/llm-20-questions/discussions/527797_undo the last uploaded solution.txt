### undo the last uploaded solution
Is it possible to cancel the current last submission? I accidentally replaced
my best solution with a completely non-working one, and the daily limits are
used up. Is there anything that can be fixed?

That's really unfortunate in this competition, because participants couldn't
set the solutions they want to use in the end, so I don't think there will be
an intervention, sorry for you :/

Sounds like divided by zero.. ,) I can't see any technical solution to this
problem, perhaps only an intervention could help? And this would rise some
interesting ethical questions… do you think it would be fair? (I'm not judging
here, just asking about your own judgment.)
