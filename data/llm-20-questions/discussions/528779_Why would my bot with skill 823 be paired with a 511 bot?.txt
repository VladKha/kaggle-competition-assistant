### Why would my bot with skill 823 be paired with a 511 bot?
It seems that in this competition, only bots with similar skills are paired
and face another random pair. And this is of course observed on many
submissions (check top ones). But it seems this is not the case for everyone?
  * I am shocked to see that my 823 bot is paired with a 511 bot, leading to an obvious defeat or draw. This is a 312 difference in skill.
  * Does anyone else experience this?

The chart is showing agent's score gain vs its score difference with its
partner before the match, i.e. `my_score - my_partner_score`. The correlation
is slightly negative `-0.070`, so it means it's slightly better to be paired
with a higher-score agent.

Good analysis. I was expecting an overall negative reward when paired with low
rated agents

I hate to share [my TrueSkill
notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gguillard/llm-20-questions-trueskill-
simulator) again and again, but there's a small section titled "Team Matching"
in which I very briefly started to explore this, you could expand the
exploration.

The coin has two sides. My two bots lost a game after a few draws and are now
stuck at 466 and 480. One lost as an answerer, and the second had a lucky
opponent :

Therefore the lost games say nothing about their skills. They'd have zero
chance to recover if they'd encounter only bots in the same range. (Now I
guess they've only _almost_ zero chance…)

It's completely normal.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
Ooh, I just saw that your 900 skill bot was paired with a 500 one as well


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
But I still wonder if it applies to everyone. It seems that once you are at
the very top, then you are safe


### [mxmm2123](/mxmm2123)
It applies to everyone, of course we can't see all the players to confirm
that, luckier bots will survive. Being at the top might be safer, but at the
same time, the bonus points for each win will be less, and facing stronger
opponent pairs, bots with lower scores have a chance.


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
Argee, but for now we still need to wait for the old keywords to be deleted
and the rankings to be reset.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
Hopefully this happens. We can't be sure. I remember
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) insisted that the new keywords would
come from the same distribution as the public keywords, and didn't want to be
very specific then. Technically, this is the case, he kept his word.


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
If so it would be a huge disappointment(at least for me).
