### Log analysis for a agent's performance
How to decipher logs? There are 4 players and multiple guesses as well as
answers in json. How do I find the guesses or questions asked by my agent?

I made <https://www.kaggle.com/code/waechter/llm-20-questions-games-dataset>
to download json logs, and format them into an easy to use dataset  
In <https://www.kaggle.com/code/waechter/llm-20-questions-leaderbord-analyze-
best-agents> i use the dataset to analyse games from the current best agents.
You can use it to analyze your own games  
Example:  
`df.loc[df.guesser='your_team_name']`  
Hope this help!
