The size is driven by the LLM choice. Are we supposed to create an LLM to meet
the limit?

Sorry about that, indeed we had a misconfiguration which should be fixed now.


### [jazivxt](/jazivxt)
Awesome, thanks! I also had some code errors that have now been corrected.
Looks like it will be a very fun competition, thank you!

We noticed that in the `llm_20_questions.py` file there looks to be a bug
where both guesser and answerer are set as "guesser". Is this the same code
used on the leaderboard?

    GUESSER = "guesser"
    ANSWERER = "guesser"

Did you mean "100 GB"? The maximum size in the rules says 100 GB.

Try submitting from my public notebook scrip5 output, message indicates 100 Mb
