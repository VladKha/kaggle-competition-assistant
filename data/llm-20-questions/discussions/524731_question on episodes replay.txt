### question on episodes replay
I recently checked my episodes replay, and I notice that there is one
simulation that my bot with -244 scores. Also I notice that there is Err on
the title.
Does someone has the simliar experience, or how I could find the error reason.
I checked the agent log but could not find anything.
Thanks,
