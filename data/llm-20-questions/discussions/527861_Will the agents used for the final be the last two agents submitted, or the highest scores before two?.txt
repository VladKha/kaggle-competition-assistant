### Will the agents used for the final be the last two agents submitted, or
the highest scores before two?
As the title suggests, are the agents used in the final the last two agents
submitted, or the two previous highest scores?

The two most active ones, because the public list is not very meaningful, I
personally feel


### [HelloGPX](/peixiangong)
I hope so.
