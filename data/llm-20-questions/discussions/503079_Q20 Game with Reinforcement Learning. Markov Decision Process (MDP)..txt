# Q20 Game with Reinforcement Learning
Playing 20 Question Game with Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Huang Hu1, Xianchao Wu, Bingfeng Luo, Chongyang Tao,Can Xu, Wei Wu
and Zhan Chen
"In this paper,the authors proposed a novel policy-based Reinforce-ment
Learning (RL) method, which enables the questioner agent to learn the optimal
policy of question selection through continuous interactions with users. To
facilitate training,they also proposed to use a reward network to estimate the
more informative reward. Compared to previous methods, their RL method is
robust to noisy answers and does not rely onthe Knowledge Base of objects.
Experimental results show that our RL method clearly outperforms an entropy-
based engineering system and has competitive performance in a noisy-free
simulation environment."
"It is not easy to design the algorithm to construct a Q20 game system.
Although the decision tree based method seems like a natural fit to the Q20
game, it typically require a well defined Knowledge Base (KB) that contains
enough information about each object, which is usually not available in
practice. It was used a object-question relevance table as the pivot for
question and object selection, which does not depend on an existing KB
(Knowledge Base). Further it was improved the relevance table with a lot of
engineering tricks. Since these table-based methods greedily select questions
and the model parameters are only updated by rules, their models are very
sensitive to noisy answers from users, which is common in the real-world Q20
games. It was utilized a value-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to
improve the generalization ability but still relies on the existing KB.
# Markov Decision Process (MDP)
"In this paper, the authors formulated the process of question selection in
the game as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and further propose a novel
policy-based RL framework to learn the optimal policy of question selection in
the Q20 game. Their questioner agent maintains a probability distribution over
all objects to model the confidence of the target object, and updates the
confidence based on answers from the user."
# RewardNet
"At each time-step the agent uses a policy network to take in the confidence
vector and output a question distribution for selecting the next question. To
solve the problem that there is no immediate reward for each selected
question, the authors also proposed to employ a RewardNet to estimate the
appropriate immediate reward at each time-step, which is further used to
calculate the long-term return to train their RL model."
"Their RL (Reinforcement Learning) framework makes the agent robust to noisy
answers since the model parameters are fully learnable and the question
distribution provides us with a principled way to sample questions, which
enables the agent to jump out of the local optimum caused by incorrect answers
and also introduces more randomness during training to improve the model
generalization ability. Furthermore, the ability to sample questions, compared
to greedy selection, also improves the diversity of the questions asked by
their agent, which is crucial for user experience."

Hey that's pretty interesting. I've bookmarked this for future reference as
I'm quite interested in the reinforcement aspect.
Just for fun, I decided to give everyone's favourite LLM a go with this game.
I wanted to see if Chats (via co-pilot) could figure out my choice of John
Maynard Keynes. Chats spent a lot of questions trying to figure out a category
(but economics wasn't a standard offering). Here's an example exchange:
> Copilot  
>  Letâ€™s narrow it down. Is this historical figure known for their scientific
> discoveries, or are they more famous for their political or social impact? ðŸ¤”  
>  You  
>  There is not a clear answer to that. They were involved in all 3,
> particularly if you take a loose view on the phrase 'scientific discoveries'
Despite the hint (regular hints) that the famous person was involved in what
some would call a social science, it never honed in on the category. I did
appreciate the emoji thoughâ€¦
It was also obvious that Chat's was struggling with keeping track of the
question number. (Perhaps it's human after all?)
> Question 12: Did this person have a significant impact in the field of art,
> music, or literature? ðŸ¤”  
>  You  
>  They wrote books. But I don't think this person would be regarded as having
> a significant impact in the field of literature.  
>  Copilot

>  Question 12: Did this person have a significant impact in the field of art,

>  You

Very nice examples JDaustralia.  
There are great competitions on Kaggle with Agents and reinforcement learning,
such as:

This way of playing the 20 Questions game is really cool! They're using
something called reinforcement learning to make a smart question-asking agent.
It learns which questions to ask by talking with people. They also have this
thing called RewardNet that helps figure out if the answers are good or not.
It's a big step forward compared to how things used to be done, which often
had problems with bad answers and needing a lot of info already set up

The fun fact is that the authors wrote that "It's not easy to design the
algorithm to construct a Q20 game system."  
If it's not easy for them, imagine for me cause I'm a beginner : ) Thank you
Giftson.
