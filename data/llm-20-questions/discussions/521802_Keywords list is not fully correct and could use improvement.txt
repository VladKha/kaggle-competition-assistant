### Keywords list is not fully correct and could use improvement
I have seen discussions of errors in keyword list and have seen instances of
this in replays myself. I (along with many other people) believe that the
keywords should be fixed and updated. Currently, I believe the most important
and frustrating thing in the keywords is when a keyword does not have enough
alternatives. Just now I had a game (with myself as it was validation) where
the keyword was guessed 3 times in one game but failed as it was slightly
different.

[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) can we get any comment on this? Will
this be resolved in the private LB?

I had a case where my Agent guessed "Vaccum" but the keyword was "Vaccum
Cleaner".
Question: Is the thing used for cleaning?  
Answer: yes  
Guess: Vaccum

But "toaster" is not the same as "toaster oven"… besides, there are "toaster
grills", "pop-up toasters", "convection toasters", "convection toaster ovens",
"air-fryer toaster ovens" and who knows what else… I have little idea how
they're diffent, but I'm sure your LLM can handle that… :P ;)
