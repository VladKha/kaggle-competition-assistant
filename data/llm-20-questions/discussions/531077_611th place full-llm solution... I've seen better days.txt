### 611th place full-llm solution... I've seen better days
I wanted to post my final submission so that others could learn from it I do
not have a highscore since my final submission wasn;'t able to submit because
of a server overload (More info
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/527990)).
Please do not take my low ranking as a sign of bad code, the notebook that was
running before my final code had a weird error that caused me to get such a
bad position. My final code has this error fixed along with some other
improvements that I sadly wasn't able to submit. In fact in the first half I
was commonly drifting around in the top-5 even had a few #1s back then. I hope
my code helps you learn something, this competition was a wonderful idea that
was poorly executed.  
Without further ado here's my code (please give me a like or comment if you
find it useful): [Solving 20 Questions with L3 and Tree of
Thought](https://www.kaggle.com/code/max1mum/solving-20-questions-with-l3-and-
