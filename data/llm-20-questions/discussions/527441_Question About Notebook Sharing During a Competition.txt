### Question About Notebook Sharing During a Competition
Hello Kagglers,
I’m trying to share my notebook with others by setting it to "Public," but the
option is disabled, leaving the notebook in "Private" mode.
I have a few questions regarding this:
I’m curious about why it’s not possible to set the notebook to "Public" while
the competition is ongoing. Is this due to competition rules, or is there
another reason for this restriction?
After the competition ends, will I be able to set the notebook to "Public"? If
so, are there any specific considerations or precautions I should be aware of
when doing this? For example, how will the notebook appear to other users once
it’s made public?
