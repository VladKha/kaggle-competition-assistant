### Disabled submissions due to limit: anyone can help?
Hi guys,
I have submitted two additional notebooks in our team with
[@risanraja32](https://www.kaggle.com/risanraja32) &
[@chandreshjsutariya](https://www.kaggle.com/chandreshjsutariya) but the
former submissions have become "Disabled due to the competition's active
submission limit". I have read again the docs of the competition but I can't
find info on this limit.
Can someone explain me how many submissions we can have and how does that work
to select the valid ones?
Thanks!
Best,
Octavio

That's really not a mystery, it is explained in the competition overview,
section "Evaluation".
