### [solved] Need help interpreting an error
Hello,
I got error in an agent which was working correctly for some time. The error
occurred in guesser agent in guessing phase. There's no error in agent log.
  1. If this was due to out-of-memory, would it be visible in agent logs?
  2. If it was due to too long guess (>100 characters), would it bu visible in agent logs/replay?

Thanks for any help,  
and good luck :)

  1. I think it wouldn't.
  2. A too long guess would be just truncated, AFAIK

It looks like your agent returned None, so it could be just any exception
being thrown. I might be wrong, though. Look at the agent log, too.

Thank you for your answer :) I didn't notice empty 'action'. I think I also
misinterpreted logs: this was during asking question, not guessing.
So I bet it returned an empty string, or maybe None somehow, but there are no
exceptions in agent log.
edit: after investigating I think there's a small possibility that my agent
returned empty string. Thanks for your help!
