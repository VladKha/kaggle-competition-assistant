### Leaderboard reset and new keywords
Hey all,
We are working on getting the leaderboard reset and the new keywords updated.
Once that has happened we will start matches again. Should be in the next 24
hours.
Good luck to you all!
UPDATE: looks like a false start, the wrong word list is currently enabled.
I'll fix that and restart once again

### [so_so](/shunsukeohashi)
I was looking through LB and found keyword "ohio" being used. (The game was
played in the past 5hours.)  
From my understanding, the HOST announced that the final keyword list will be
only things and not peoples or places.
I specifically instructed my LLM not to guess peoples or places keyword, so
would really want to see only things keyword appearing in the game played
after our final subs.
Am I missing something? Looking forward to hearing feedbacks and comments.  
("ohio" is a state in USA which is a place right?)  
Thank you.

### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Just let the man be please… I am tired with his changes already honestly.
People will never be satisfied, one way or another, and he will never stop
changing… this competition looks like a mess already. Let it close..


### [so_so](/shunsukeohashi)
Thank you for your comment. Yes, I agree with you that this competition could
have been done in a better way and we are kind of tired from all the changes
made. Having said that, knowing the issue and fixing the issue is another
thing. If the issue is not being noticed by the HOST and participants of this
competition, I thought the issue needs to be raised so that it can be used to
make future competition better (or if it is possible, make this competition
better). I want to be constructive.


### [Jonathan Chan](/jonathanchan)
Totally agreed. Just want this competition to be over ASAP now. This is very
tiring and the host may be handpicking now. Look forward to the next edition
for sure though.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) I'm not sure that your latest private
LB reset on Aug 15th removed the duplicate words from private LB keywords. I
did some analysis. Analyzing all 17k private LB games played between 5am UTC
Aug 15th thru 5am UTC Aug 18th, we observe that 7.7% (i.e. 139 out of 1798)
keywords are duplicates of keywords from Public LB. I published analysis
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/529115)


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) please consider this, 7.7% is too
much. We still have enough time to start everything over again.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
I don't want to suggest anything particular, but there are also other options
than a complete restart, and have both the keywords and the ranking algorithm
fixed.


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
If don't reset the leaderboard, we need to increase the frequency of matches
so that the stuck bots have a chance.  
For the ranking algorithm, I propose to divide the points in match tie by the
cosine similarity between the final prediction and the true keyword to
determine the winner.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
I have updated my post to include all 23,958 private LB games from Aug 15th
UTC 5am thru Aug 19th UTC 5am. The statistics are still the same.


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff
I responded to this here:
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/529115#2965419>


### [francesco fiamingo](/francescofiamingo)
Dear Bovard, there are tens of message that ask to cancel the old set(like you
said), i think we should figure out how to do or inform about what to do….


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
I have seen at least 4 wins in keywords in the previous list of fixed bot.
Clearing old keywords and restarting the game is necessary now. Increasing the
frequency of playing for agents also needs to be considered for the
convergence of the leaderboards. We have worked hard for many months for this
competition, so don't let it go to waste.  
btw: I see keyword "cave" in this eps
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-
episode-55743392> Is it readly in category things?


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Well, in a $50k prize Kaggle competition where rules were explicitly said by
the organizers, and despite so many calls from serious competitors spending 3
months of efforts on it, you can’t just simply ignore everything and let it
flow wrongly like this… We all hope for a solution, at least removal of the
used keywords in the secret private set to comply with what was put by the
host… let’s make things right together…


### [dynamic24](/dynamic24)
The reuse of keywords from the previous list is a huge issue in terms of the
outcome of the contest. It will reward bots that have the previous keyword and
scraped keyword lists hardcoded (bots that would be weeded out otherwise). And
it will punish people who took Kaggle at their word that previous keywords
would not be used and built that information into their bot
(<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/523198)>.
Another restart with a cleaned keyword list would be the fairest way to move
forward.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
[@addisonhoward](https://www.kaggle.com/addisonhoward)
[@mylesoneill](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) please review our request


### [Feida Wei](/feidawei)
Have the organizers gone completely MIA for the past few days?  
However, if I am being hopeful I think they are spending lots of time
rechecking the new private keyword list but I could be wrong. An update from
the hosts would be nice.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
We should do an analysis of which words are being correctly answered now in
private LB. If the majority of successful games are because of previous public
LB words then this supports the idea that the duplicated words are making a
big difference and we need to fix things immediately.


### [Matthew S Farmer](/matthewsfarmer)
I'm not sure if it would be that simple. Some players could have deployed an
anti-keyword list, forcing the bot to avoid any keywords used previously in
the competition. These bots would never have a win as guesser and would be
excluded from the count.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
A single loss derails one’s bot forever given this very slow schedule and big
reward at the start. That single loss accounts for plus or minus 137 points
which is 274 points.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
[@cdeotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) great idea! I am writing a notebook
to analyze the impact from scraped games. Should be available soon in 24
hours.


### [dynamic24](/dynamic24)
Yes, some bots have a list of "anti-keywords". My bots have a 0% chance for
previously used keywords. I wouldn't have created an anti-keyword list if
organizers hadn't repeatedly said that words wouldn't be reused in the test
set.


### [ISAKA Tsuyoshi](/isakatsuyoshi)
I also incorporate the same process. Even if it's just a few percent, small
differences can lead to significant changes. I trust that the host is working
diligently towards a solution.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
I analyzed whether keywords duplicated in private LB and public LB are easier
to guess. According to a Z-Test for Two Proportions published
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/529115),
it is statistically significant easier to guess duplicated words.


### [francesco fiamingo](/francescofiamingo)
Dear Bovard, if old keywords still in the set , people using codes linked to
their identification , will win much easier then teams that used LMM and
hibrid models, in reality to detect the word is not an easy game from
infinitive words, i suggest take 24h , clean properly and run again, overall
is the first time for such competitions, i see normal to refine the
“competition model”, have a nice day!


### [Azat Akhtyamov](/azakhtyamov)
Are you sure you have changed the keywords? I've seen banana in the previous
"hidden" keywords list.

### [NIWATORI](/niwatori)
We also see equivalent words like "modem" in the final evaluation and "Modem"
in keywords.py.

### [Mahmoud Elshahed](/letemoin)
smartphone also exist in current evaluation keywords


### [Jonathan Chan](/jonathanchan)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard): The new wordlist still contains
keywords from the older list. The current 1st place score is from a game with
the keyword "smartphone". Would another restart be needed?


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Since [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) confirmed the new list won’t
contain any used words, a lot of participants coded their solutions to NOT
predict those old words. I think another restart is compulsory. Then we may
need to also extend the evaluation period since we lost 2 days already.


### [oks](/keisho)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) We've also noticed that "paperweight"
appeared in the final evaluation, while "Paperweights" was included in the
previous list of keywords.  
I suggest applying [compare_words](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-
environments/blob/367ad4598c76e7440261c5d610519122c094b48c/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/llm_20_questions.py#L304-L321)
to remove any duplicate keywords from the previous list.


### [yukky_maru](/yukkymaru)
In the `keywords.py` file, [there is an entry for
"Plate."](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-
environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/keywords.py)
However, in my game, the keyword "plate" is currently being used. Is this
intended behavior? [Even though the game normalizes case
differences](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-
environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/llm_20_questions.py),
as well as the ending "s," "es," and "the," does the keywords.py file treat
"Plate" and "plate" as different entries?
This is probably not the only case. Although I'm not sure about the exact
update time for meta-kaggle, once it is updated,By using this excellent
[public notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/waechter/llm-20-questions-games-
dataset) to create a dataframe, it should be possible to search simply by
filtering the dataframe based on the creation time(>08-15) and keyword matches
using [compare_words](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-
environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/llm_20_questions.py).

### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard), is it still a false start as the
update says? Or are the current games correct?


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
The pace of games is a little bit worrying. At this pace, around 6-10 games a
day, if someone falls into the "pit", they're like.. doomed, coz it takes many
many games to get out of there even for a good agent…
Moreover it seems the selection to the matches is quite unbalanced, some
agents played only 1-2 times so far, some other already 7.


### [Mahmoud Elshahed](/letemoin)
Ratio Of Games  
Ratio of Answerer vs (Guesser and Asker) Role  
if possible also "Ratio of single keywords, or more than one word"
these need to be considered


### [yuanzhe zhou](/yuanzhezhou)
Too much randomness


### [Songling](/wolfmedal)
I feel like it depends on luck.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Increasing game pace is a must, and I don't think Kaggle have any resource
issues with it since each team only has 2 bots for now. Maybe the frequency
algorithm (for instance, determined by "days_since_submit") doesn't exploit
resource to its full extent.


### [yukky_maru](/yukkymaru)
Hello. I have created a script to detect keywords from games that took place
after August 15 and match them with those included in `keyword.py` through
`compare_words`. I would like to share the results with you. Currently, the
notebook cannot be shared due to the evaluation period, but I can provide it
later, and I can immediately share it with the organizers if requested. The
data has been sourced from Meta Kaggle, and currently, it only includes game
data from 03:48 to 05:20 on August 15. By tomorrow, I expect the complete data
for August 15 to be added to Meta Kaggle.
Between 03:48 and 05:20, I have listed the duplicate words found through
`compare_words` below. In reality, games continued after 05:20 on August 15,
and I believe there are many more duplicates found through `compare_words`.
Many users are making various efforts to avoid answering these words, and I
consider this to be an issue that should be addressed.

### [ISAKA Tsuyoshi](/isakatsuyoshi)
[@yukkymaru](https://www.kaggle.com/yukkymaru)  
Hello! Thank you for your wonderful contribution!
If you happen to know, could you please share what percentage of the old
keywords that should have been deleted are included?(e.g. 5% vs. 50% is a big
difference)


### [yukky_maru](/yukkymaru)
Thank you for the comment! If my script is not mistaken, it should be around
5%. It seems that Meta Kaggle hasn't been updated yet, so the information is
from 03:48 to 05:20 on August 15.


### [dynamic24](/dynamic24)
Thank you for your analysis of reused keywords. Considering the rather low
average win rate, 5% repeated words is really quite a lot. Bots that do a
binary search on the public keyword list will do rather well when they get a
reused word and will end up with a fairly good score.


### [yukky_maru](/yukkymaru)
No exact matches were found; all matches were found using compare_words. When
it was stated that 'keywords from keyword.py would not be used,' was this
referring to exact matches or matches found by compare_words? If it was the
latter, then the current behavior is incorrect, and with a few lines of code,
it can be fixed, so I would appreciate it if you could make that correction.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
It's worrisome the top of the LB has already started to play with their
neighbors. Only after a couple of games, I think this is waay too soon. The
selection range should be much wider for much longer for a proper convergence.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
I think that's because Kaggle manually adjusted the magnitude of reward for
this competition where draws are plenty. It needs to be rolled back to about
50 points or less, from the first game, otherwise if some bots winning 5 first
games then they will stay forever on top.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
Really worrying. The pairing with bots of similar performance should only
happen in the last 2 days for example. If it starts now, many good agents will
be doomed


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Wrt [@lohmaa](https://www.kaggle.com/lohmaa) 's concern and regarding the
unbalanced bot picking between the 2 bots, I have the lastest bot picked 10
times while the other only 2 times. That means the picking algorithm favors
the more recent submitted bots, which was true for previous simulation
competition, because there was no LB reset like in this comp.
Anyone can confirm if seeing the same pattern.
I think it must be completely random for this picking. Another important thing
to be adjusted, otherwise we all will end up with 1 bot playing 100 games
while the other only 20 games, for example.
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard)


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
That's quite a difference, but I cannot confirm, my bots played 6 and 5 times
(in order of submission.) Also, I think the ranking algorithm in the previous
stage used the score of agents to determine frequency of play, not the order
of submissions.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
I don't think it is the score of agents to determine frequency, because if you
fall into a pitfall you can't recover, and Kaggle may know this.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@khahuras](https://www.kaggle.com/khahuras) _In the previous stage_ , i.e.
during testing/development. Now the algorithm is surely different.


### [raconion](/raconion)
I have been seeing failing episodes repeatedly with NAN loss. Does anyboday
have similar issue? I have had two failed episode for one of my agent.
Since the number of games played is one of the **most important factor** to
determine the rank of good bots, I strongly suggest that the host starts a new
episode for failed episode players to ensure the fairness of this game
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard)


### [Bhanu Prakash M](/bhanupm)
Can something be done for cases like this or is it just unlucky :
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/528200)


### [Bhanu Prakash M](/bhanupm)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) My last submission was a late
submission (submitted after the competition closed). This late submission in
turn disabled a perfectly fine older submission. Its fine if you don't count
the late submission towards the final 2 agents, but this disabled agent also
disabled my previous submission. Now this means I have only 1 agent present
for the final leaderboard, I think this is a bug. Hope this post makes sense
lol.

### [Bhanu Prakash M](/bhanupm)
Thanks for resolving my issue so fast!


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
Is the "Agent Alpha" strategy a violation of the rules? I’ve noticed that many
bots are starting with the question, "Is it Agent Alpha?" At first, I didn’t
understand why, but then I realized the reason: If the answer is 'yes,' they
switch to an 'alphabetical order' approach, where all the bots start asking
the exact same questions. If the answer is 'no,' they revert to the standard
approach. Here are some examples (there are many more, but I’ve just taken the
top two):
  1. when the answer is 'yes':  
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-
episode-55736750>  
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-
episode-55733364>
  2. when the answer is 'no':   
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-
episode-55734411>  
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-
episode-55736873>
I have nothing against using the alphabetical order approach; however, in this
case, it involves sharing context between different teams. Specifically,
they’ve shared a "secret question," which violates the rule against private
sharing outside of teams.
I believe many users have tried the alphabetical order search in one way or
another and found that LLMs often provide incorrect answers without additional
information. In this scenario, I think the bots are using standard Python code
to parse the question and compare the words in alphabetical order. This code
seems to be triggered by the "secret" question: "Is it Agent Alpha?"—which, in
my opinion, is a direct violation of the rules.
Although I don't have access to the code for these agents and therefore can't
be 100% certain, it would be great if [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard)
could clarify whether this violates the rules or not.
Thank you in advance!


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
The agent alpha thing is real, in most cases, simple Python code is used to
compare words in alphabetical order. But this is not a violation to the rules.
My concern though is why does the alphabetical ordering strategy seem to work
so well? Maybe the keywords are too easy or too similar to the public data on
which such approaches were fine-tuned.


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
My concern isn't with the alphabetical order approach itself. It's about how
the agents know when to switch to the simple Python code and start comparing
words in alphabetical order. Imagine if I programmed my bot to ask questions
like, "HeyHey, is it 'A'?" and then directly told you and 10 other
participants, "If you see 'HeyHey,' check the first letter of the keyword." In
my opinion, this would be a violation because I would have shared information
outside the Kaggle environment. To me, this case seems similar; it's just that
instead of 'HeyHey,' there is the question: Is it Agent Alpha?


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@chernovandrey1998](https://www.kaggle.com/chernovandrey1998) Yes, that's how
it works ;) The issue you raised has been debated a few times already. Nobody
could point to any rules that are violated. Have you seen those rules?
++ The private sharing pertains to private code sharing, not just asking weird
questions during the game. The "Is it Agent Alpha?" handshake is not private
at all, it has always been public. But had it been unseen before, then you're
right -- all this would indicate some collusion.
++ Funny enough, the original motivation behind the public handshake was to
neutralize any benefit from secret collusion.
++ You can take a look at [this
notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lohmaa/llm20-agent-alpha)


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
Yes, I've seen the rule. I think that this approach violates this written
rule:  
"No private sharing outside teams  
Privately sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted. It's okay to
share code if made available to all participants on the forums."
Let me try to explain why I think so:  
My concern isn't about the code itself. My concern is that additional
instructions were likely shared outside of the teams—specifically, the logic
of what to do after asking the question, "Is it Agent Alpha?" I would argue
that these instructions constitute information, and since any information is
data, this would violate the rules.


### [Benedikt Droste](/benbla)
The notebook is public available…


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
Let me try to explain myself better:
In terms of logic:  
I believe that it’s simply not fair and completely changes the competition. I
could program a bot using 'secret' clue words and then share these words in a
public environment with instructions like: "If you see this word, do the
following."
In terms of rules:
  1. I have no complaints about the code itself.
  2. My concern is that data was shared between different teams outside of the Kaggle environment. I’ve explained my reasoning in my previous comment.
I hope this clarifies my opinion. In any case, I suggest we wait for the
organizers to provide further guidance.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@chernovandrey1998](https://www.kaggle.com/chernovandrey1998) It's strange to
insist that
> data was shared between different teams outside of the Kaggle environment
no it wasn't, this premise is basically not true.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
So, is the alphabetical ordering the winner in this otherwise tough
competition? I would be disappointed.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
It’s not determining the winner. The winner will be the bot with both alpha
ability and good LLM when paired with non-alpha answerer.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
I don't think so. Winning several "alpha agent" games and drawing with some
other teams will make you winner. If Kaggle does nothing about it, only
"alphabetical ordering question-based agents" will win the competition without
any other effort.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
But that's ok, it is a valid approach after all. I am just arguing that this
competition can be summarized as "alphabetical ordering is all you need"


### [yukky_maru](/yukkymaru)
The behavior of LLMs is fundamentally unpredictable. Therefore, to win this
competition, it’s crucial to closely observe the questions posed by other
agents and opt not to use LLMs by resorting to hard coding instead. In fact, a
public notebook that acquired and analyzed all the agents' questions from Meta
Kaggle won a silver medal. Besides narrowing down using "Does the keyword (in
lowercase) precede" by "Agent Alpha," other patterns include "Does the keyword
start with one of the letters?" or "Is the keyword one of the following?"
Additionally, about 15 other fixed phrases were observed. Responding to these
phrases with hard coding is naturally a tactic to improve performance.
Moreover, using fixed phrases yourself may increase accuracy, as there is a
high possibility that others have also developed countermeasures. Diversity is
important in competitions, and I found these kinds of strategies to be
excellent innovations.


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
I have nothing against the questions like "Does the keyword (in lowercase)
precede" by "Agent Alpha," or "Does the keyword start with one of the
letters?"
My concern is only about the question: "Is it agent Alpha". This question
implicitly gives the instruction to use the simple python script to compare
alphabetical order and the agent understands this instruction based on the
agreement, which was made outside kaggle environment. Please check my previous
examples with the secret clue words. I think it explains my logic in a simple
manner.


### [yukky_maru](/yukkymaru)
I see. I fully understand your point now. First of all, I would like to
apologize for my previous reply, which was based on a misunderstanding. I
sincerely apologize, Chernov.
Indeed, if the response to "Is it agent Alpha?" is "Yes," and the system
changes its behavior based on that, then if this had been agreed upon
externally (as in "promised"), it would fall under pre-shared information
outside of the game. In fact, in the public notebook, this was used as a
handshake, but whether it goes as far as being "promised" is something I
cannot judge. Currently, people who have read the agent Alpha public notebook
are "interpreting it on their own," but given the programming aspect, "their
interpretations are almost 100% consistent." Whether you view this state of
"interpreting it on their own" but "with interpretations being almost 100%
consistent" as "shared information" depends on the organizer. However,
If the question was "Are you agent Alpha?" instead of "Do you understand the
order of the alphabet correctly, and when given two keywords, can you always
arrange them in the correct order?" it would be completely clear, but since
"agent Alpha" has an externally (in the public notebook) embedded meaning,
it's in a gray area, and I think it's up to the organizer to decide.If two
users had made an external agreement, for example, that they would only behave
differently.
If two users had made an external agreement, for example, that they would only
behave differently if the question "Are you a water strider?" was answered
with "Yes," then this would clearly be a violation. However, in this case, the
specification where different behavior occurs only when the question "Are you
agent Alpha?" is answered with "Yes" is being "independently and deliberately
implemented" by each user on their own accord.


### [Dawid Motyka](/dawidmt)
I understand your perspective. There's surely no problem with the alphabetical
approach, but agent identification seems not entirely "right". However, it
seems to be true that there's no rule against this. I think that
identification of agents should have been addressed by organizers, but to
forbid it would probably require manual checking of code.
Using binary search, we can guess perfectly about 500k predefined phrases with
19 questions. I think that a good dictionary generated for this will cover the
vast majority of phrases in the hidden set. We don't even need to bother with
any questions - the answerer could just binary encode 19bit number (the index
of a predefined dictionary) with yes/no.


### [Sadhaklal](/sambitmukherjee)
I think the Agent Alpha handshake protocol is an interesting idea. Whether
it's legal or not depends on the answer to the following question:
Is it ok to exchange information about the identity / type of the answerer? Or
do all the questions need to be only about the keyword?
For example, is it ok for the initial question to be: "Are you Llama 3.1"?
In a human 20 questions game, is it ok to ask a question about the identity of
the answerer? For example, is it ok to ask "Are you European?" to the
answerer? -> If the answer is "yes", perhaps it would make sense to ask about
things which are more commonly found in Europe.
I don't have a stance on this issue. It's for the competition host to decide.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
One more interesting remark to add -- a communication handshake is more
natural than it seems in the context of the game. People do it all the time,
for instance when we go abroad and we don't know which language shall we
speak, we ask "Do you speak English?", "Hablas Espanol?" -- often because we
don't want to waste time talking if they can't understand.. so it's kind of a
natural thing to do. Actually it would be much more awkward and artificial to
prevent that for the sake of some distilled gameplay.
++ so in the end I think a handshake like "Do you speak Alpha?" would be much
better..


### [ISAKA Tsuyoshi](/isakatsuyoshi)
I have a solution achieved a public score of 1023.5 (highest) , securing 3rd
place. The score was achieved with three wins as a guesser (Agent Alpha
victories not included) , zero losses, and three draws. In a similar
subsequent submission, it scored 982.9, remaining within the gold medal range,
with three wins as a guesser (Agent Alpha victories not included) and one win
as an answerer, consistently reaching the gold medal range. The Alpha protocol
was added for the final submission. Besides the Alpha protocol, there are
various strategies such as using LLMs for guessing, listing through examples,
and offline policies. It is up to each Kaggler to decide whether to adopt
them. It would be unfair to Kagglers who have committed months of effort if
the rules were changed after the final submission. If the Alpha protocol were
to be banned, I believe it would have been announced in the 'Competition
Update' post 16 days ago. In that post, it was mentioned that 'Question
character length limit reduced from 2000 to 750 (the extra character limit was
unused other than for “binary search” type questions).' Additionally, efforts
have been made to design the competition so that simply using the Alpha
protocol alone would not guarantee victory, considering the keyword updates


### [ISAKA Tsuyoshi](/isakatsuyoshi)
Anyway, I intend to share my solution and source code after the competition
ends, as I want to contribute to the community. This competition is not so
simple that you can win just by using the Alpha protocol. I'm looking forward
to seeing the various ideas and innovations that different Kagglers have come
up with.

The difference between this and the alpha approach is that with alpha, both
sides share a predefined algorithm. And given your example with "Are you
European?" - if the answer is yes, the guesser can use **his own** knowledge
how European may answer, but not any predefined rules.
After a successful handshake (and sharing the same keyword list), both agents
may act in a way completely predictable for themselves, making it look more
like one algorithm and not the cooperation of two algorithms. In other words,
the game becomes deterministic.
Still, I clearly don't like the alpha approach, but there was no clear
statement that this was forbidden before closing the competition, so we cannot
just ban it now.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@dawidmt](https://www.kaggle.com/dawidmt) The team players don't have to
share the same algorithm, and they don't need to share the same set of
keywords. All the questioner wants is to _recognize_ the answerer and the
answerer has to recognize the questions. So actually it's just a simple
question-answer protocol they need to adopt, nothing else in particular.


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
"The team players don't have to share the same algorithm" - that is simply not
true. In this case, they are sharing the same implicit instructions, which
were not mentioned at all in the questions during the bot's communications.
This is why agents from different teams become dependent on each other,
leading to a violation of the rules. After reading all these comments, I feel
even more confident in my position.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
[@chernovandrey1998](https://www.kaggle.com/chernovandrey1998) I am just
curious why didn’t you bring this matter up about 2 months ago when this
method was shared publicly and the forum discussed, debated about it a lot? Or
you just see it performing well, hate it, and try your best to eliminate many
teams that are definitely rule-abiding?


### [Dawid Motyka](/dawidmt)
[@loh-maa](https://www.kaggle.com/loh-maa)  
I understand that this seems to be "just a protocol". But this protocol serves
just one purpose, and both sides realize this one purpose predictably.
I've just said that after a handshake, agents **may** act in any predefined
way. And this was to raise the question of where we can draw the line between
what is acceptable and what is not. Would you say that the handshake "Will you
send me a keyword using an index of our predefined dictionary {version of
dictionary}" as 19 bit number?" is also acceptable? It would, of course,
require parsing this question with regex and following a simple protocol.
Another approach would be to ask to encode the first 3 or 4 characters of
keywords and also the number of words with 2 bits. What connects all these
approaches and alpha is that there is a predefined question that is used to
set the answerer or guesser in a specific state. I think that the reasonable
line here is agent identification, and it separates LLM approaches from
internal protocols.
To be clear, I just think that it would be better if organizers made a
statement on this before the deadline (I personally didn't have much time for
competition and also to be involved in a discussion about binary search). I
think that many people just didn't use alpha because they were afraid that
they would be disqualified. Now, it is too late to say that agent alpha
violates the rules.


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
[@khahuras](https://www.kaggle.com/khahuras)
  1. I didn't notice this before; if I had, I would have brought it up earlier."
  2. Let's respect each other and not turn this into a typical Twitter thread. I believe some teams gained an unfair advantage, which is why I reported it. This is how a community works. The final decision rests with the organizers, so please don't take it personally.
As a compromise, the organizers may add a condition that the so-called 'alpha
agents' won't be on the same team during the private dataset phase. I am not
sure whether this is technically feasible or not, but this would eliminate the
unfair advantage gained through your cooperation. However, I would prefer a
complete ban on these teams to protect merit and fairness.


### [Dawid Motyka](/dawidmt)
As I said before, I don't think that this is the same thing because "are you
agent alpha" sets the state of the guesser, and a predefined string is used to
follow the protocol. What you say here is "this is legitimate because it looks
legitimate looking at the game log". But binary search really doesn't need it.
After a handshake, bare keywords may just be sent to the answerer if he knows
that he is let's call it "agent binary search". Alpha-like agents just use
natural language to make the game seem "human", but they don't really have to.
Doesn't it make it seem odd?


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
[@dawidmt](https://www.kaggle.com/dawidmt) There is actually no need for any
formal handshake or state setting at all. From the LB, you can tell that team
"Full Powered Agent" is doing that and can save 1 question. You don't need to
ask "are you alpha?" in the first question. You can directly ask "does the
keyword precede…" from the first question. If the answerer is able to do so,
then it's good. If not, then ok. A team like that doesn't set the state or
trying to make any handshake at all. In the long run it can beat other alpha
agents on average thanks to saving 1 turn. (of course there are more factors
like the prepared list word coverage percentage and list word count, but you
get the idea).


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
[@khahuras](https://www.kaggle.com/khahuras) Let me provide you with an
example of an agent, and please justify whether you think it would be legal or
not.
Imagine that I create an agent entirely based on secret words, using the
following logic:
1.The question: "HeyHey 'A'?" means the responder needs to check the first
letter of the keyword and return 'yes' if it is 'A'.  
2.The question: "OlaOla 5?" means the responder needs to check the length of
the keyword and respond with 'yes' if the length is less than 5 characters.  
3.The question: "YehYeh 'B'?" means the responder needs to check the last
letter of the keyword and respond with 'yes' if it is a 'B'.  
…
I can create thousands of such rules and then share them publicly with the
community. Then with the subgroups of participants we could agree that asking
the question "Is it the Agent Beta?" would trigger this agent. Would you
consider this agent to be fair?


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Your example is weird. First, this is a public community where everybody is
capable of everything. You have to share your code publicly for everyone to
see and understand what OlaOla means, like AgentAlpha. Asking "OlaOla" or
"Heyhey" like that doesn't make your bot stronger. In your code you have to
code the answerer to be able to decode "OlaOla" or "Heyhey", and then what's
the point of "Ola Ola" anymore? You can explicitly ask "Is the first character
A" instead of "Heyhey A", because you can pair with a bot that is unable to
understand Heyhey.
That's why your responsibility is to scrape for games and search for those
questions and answer them correctly for your own bot.
In my implementation, I searched for questions such as:  
"Does the keyword start with any letters a,b,c,d…"  
"Does the keyword any of these words: bus", car, …"  
Especially this question: "Does the keyword precede "abc" in alphabetical
order?"
So whenever my bot acts as the answerer, it will be able to answer those types
of questions correctly without using LLM.  
Does that sound fair to you?


### [Dawid Motyka](/dawidmt)
> There is actually no need for any formal handshake or state setting at all.
> From the LB, you can tell that team "Full Powered Agent" is doing that and

[@khahuras](https://www.kaggle.com/khahuras) This is interesting. There's
indeed no agent identification or setting of the state. Considering my point
of view on what can or shouldn't be done, I wouldn't be against it. The team
had to take the risk that the answerer wouldn't be able to answer correctly.
The risk when using handshake is just losing one question.
I think that this is a nice example of how taking the risk of assuming some
skills of the answerer is beneficial for assessing what LLMs can and cannot
do. It would be interesting if 8B llms with prompts used by Full Powered Agent
were much more capable of judging alphabetical order (I'm not sure they will
be).


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
"You can explicitly ask "Is the first character A" instead of "Heyhey A"". -
For sure I can, but the a LLM bot might give the wrong answer. At my example I
would use a deterministic code to answer this questions and at this case I
would get 100% accuracy. The problem is that this deterministic code is
triggered by predefined 'secret' words or questions.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
There is no such things as "secret". Everything has been published publicly
and transparently. Please stop obfuscate the scenario. I suppose you are new
to Kaggle simulation competitions. In the past there are many competitions
that will need to identify other agents to work better. For example in Halite
a few years ago (Kaggle comp), a battle royale game of 4 agents (1 vs 1 vs 1
vs 1) like in a classic Starcraft game. You will need to determine the
patterns of other bots and try to form an early alliance in the game. That is:
before the two of us fight each other, let's form a team to beat the other 2
bots, then we can fight each other alone. If you don't agree to find a
teammate and try to act on your own, you may fight with 3 other bots earlier
and your team is more like to lose first. It is a zero-sum game of
collaborative + competitive match-up. In this comp, the questioner and the
answerer must collaborate with each other, and within the rules.  
I won't comment on this matter anymore, it has taken me too much time.


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
The key difference with the Halite competition example is that, in the Halite
case, the agreement was made during the simulation. Before the simulation
began, you did not have any agreements or contracts with other participants.
However, in the case of Agent Alpha, the agreement was made outside the
simulation environment, before the simulation even started, giving you an
unfair advantage.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)

[@chernovandrey1998](https://www.kaggle.com/chernovandrey1998) Certainly you
could create thousands of such strange strategies, all of them equally
powerful to alpha (not more powerful) -- but would it mean "therefore alpha is
not fair"? Just because you could create thousands of such strategies? Doesn't
it sound a bit irrational? … I will try not to bother this thread anymore. I
think it might be better to open a new thread in the main forum if you'd like
to continue, please.


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
Sorry that it was not clear, but my point is that if these rules are
considered illegal, then Agent Alpha should also be considered illegal. The
only difference is that Agent Alpha disguises these rules under human-friendly
speech. Essentially, the underlying logic remains the same, which means that
if one is unfair, the other should be as well.
I am also a bit tired of this discussion, because there are clearly two
different opinions, which are not going to converge. So I would suggest to
wait until the organisers will respond


### [yukky_maru](/yukkymaru)
If the question 'Are you Japanese?' leads to a change in behavior when the
answer is 'Yes' (for example, including more guesses of anime character
keywords), it is an understandable approach. This method does not narrow down
the meaning beyond the mere words but cannot refine the words beyond the
framework of the game. Creating questions tailored for Japanese people and
others is a very good choice. However, the question 'Are you Agent Alpha?'
does not have any inherent meaning in the words themselves; its meaning is
defined outside of the game. The act of creating questions specifically
tailored for Agent Alpha, whose meaning is defined outside the game, may be
seen as a gray area. An agent that conducts binary search without a handshake
carries the risk of complete failure if it is not prepared. However, the
handshake question 'Are you Agent Alpha?' does not carry such a risk and can
be seen as gaining the ability to handle all agents through the 'meaning of
words outside the game.' But this 'meaning of words outside the game' is
something that people who have read the Agent Alpha public notebook are
'interpreting on their own.' However, from the perspective of programming, it
can be said that 'their interpretations are almost 100% consistent.' Whether
to view this state of 'interpreting on their own, but with interpretations
being almost 100% consistent' as 'shared information' depends on the
organizer's judgment.

Based on What?,  
highest score is not a criteria at all, the best agent is the one who has high
correct guessing rate "in my Opinion" and this doesn't reflect to score due to
pairing and multiple games results.
Any way, that 's why many teams near the end resubmit their best performing
agent `from their perspective` to enter evaluation with it.


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)

It seems that one player's Error increased the score of 3 other players,
including his teammate. It seemed to me that the penalty should be for two
teammates, but I checked public episodes and it worked similar.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
That is expected, although not well designed. I think only the error bot is
punished and 3 other bots stay as is, otherwise a group of bot can produce
error on purpose when matching with a master bot (just a case). “Are you
master Roshi ?’ —> “yes” —> suicide


### [Raki](/raki21)
I don't think that's remotely worth it, the problem is that you only have a
self match every 1000 rounds and for a 1 in 1000 1/3 win you sacrifice 1 of 2
spots.
Also if noone gets points but one loses it you'ld have a slow but consistent
decay of average Elo I think


### [yukky_maru](/yukkymaru)
I don’t think this is a good design. If this behavior is exploited, in
situations like late-game scenarios where an agent is stuck (for example, when
an Agent Alpha type or an offline policy type doesn't have the word in its
dictionary), it might become a rational action—if one abandons ethics—to
inject an error on the opponent, hoping for a last chance.

[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) : Just like to point out a potential
loophole as internet is enabled and externals files may be read. I've not seen
any rules/regulations against that yet. One solution is to not to have the
episodes visible so that the new keywords cannot be extracted during this
assessment period. Otherwise some agents may have an unfair advantage over
others with updating dataset(s). I decided not to choose such agents as my
final 2 selections. Perhaps I should have if such practice will not be banned.
As we are in the transition period, the rules may be clarified further now, as
necessary. I wonder if there are other potential loopholes that others have
discovered, other than deliberately trying to cause the partner agent to
error. This trick should be allowed as it is well-known and most agents have
guarded against such tactic already.
