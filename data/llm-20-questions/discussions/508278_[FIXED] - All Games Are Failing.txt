### [FIXED] - All Games Are Failing
I noticed that beginning on May 28th around 23:00 UTC, all games have been
failing. When we view games on the LB or inside our personal submissions page,
we see all teams received `NAN` points and if we click to review the game, we
get the error message: `Unable to load episode replay: 54897616`

Thanks for reporting - we are investigating.


### [AAElter](/aaelter)
I submitted 3 submissions and they are still "submitting", hanging there for
about 12 hours, without coming to an end as a succeeded or failed submission.

This should be resolved in the next 6 hours or so as the servers work through
the backlog of episodes


### [AAElter](/aaelter)
Thanks! I appreciate your info.
