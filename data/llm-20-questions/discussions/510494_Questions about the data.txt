### Questions about the data
Hi, I've noticed that `keywords.py` gives a list of keywords. I'm wondering
that whether there will be private keywords in the online evaluation? Will the
categories and keywords all come from the given `keywords.py` through the
whole competition?

Hi. No, the private LB will have different keywords. Furthermore, we will not
have access to the private keyword list. So our final solution should not use
the `keywords.py` file.
Also the current public LB list will change very soon, explained

Thank you! I didn't see [this

before. According to my understanding, the categories will be stable, but the
keywords will change across the whole competition, and a private word set will
be used in the final period. Is that correct?

yes, categories will be person, place or thing

Then why are the questions asked about the country? As in the starter
notebook, the few_shot_examples variable contains questions about the country.
Is the country considered as the fourth category?
