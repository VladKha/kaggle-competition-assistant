### New hidden keywords
As of now, some of the keywords are pulled from a hidden test set. In this set
there are 500 location (from keywords.py), 500 things (from keywords.py), and
1000 new things (the hidden set).
We will reveal the full list of these hidden keywords in a few weeks (and
possibly add more). That said we hope to minimize changes to the keyword set
and keep these as representative as possible of the final dataset.
We will continue to monitor the leaderboard and agents to make sure we have a
robust competition.
Good luck and happy Kaggling!

[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) Sorry if this is already answered
somewhere, I've checked all other threads and I'm still confused. So I figured
asking this here for me + other people reading this in the future:
Can you confirm to us which of this is the case for this competition?
  * public LB is from keywords.py + a hidden set of keywords. Private LB is from **this same set** of hidden keywords
  * public LB is from keywords.py + a hidden set of keywords. Private LB is from **a totally different** of hidden keywords
  * other?
Thank you


### [Naive Experimentalist](/kowjan1)
i would bet for the 2nd option


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)

The private LB is from the same set of hidden keywords. Though none of them
will be re-used for the final evaluation


### [DJ Sterling](/dster)

We've removed the large majority of location keywords due to typos, obscurity,
and to help address existing stale agents which were hardcoded for those
targets. We will consider adding new entries to the `place` category soon as
well.


### [Max Brown](/maxbr0wn)
If you've already added these 'hidden set' keywords to the set of keywords
that are currently being used during matchups, then what stops us from
gleaning them by looking at/scraping the episode replays? Thanks!
edit: also, the keywords.py file in the "Data" section of this competition
only has categories for countries, cities, and landmarks. Where can we see the
list of "things"? EDIT: Here is a link to a version of keywords.py that is
more complete than the one currently in the Data section of this competition:

environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/keywords.py>


### [Matthew S Farmer](/matthewsfarmer)
Check out the kaggle environment GitHub repo.


### [waechter](/waechter)
You can see the list of keywords "things" in my notebook:
<https://www.kaggle.com/code/waechter/llm-20-questions-games-
dataset/output?select=keywords.csv>  
I think nothing prevent us from downloading the episode replays and seeing the
new keywords


### [Max Brown](/maxbr0wn)
the version of keywords.py in the github repo (link in my OP in this thread)
has "things" category


### [Max Brown](/maxbr0wn)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) could you please tell me if I am
allowed to scrape the contents of the competition leaderboard so that I can
share an analysis of which different strategies competitors are using with the
community? Kaggle doesn't seem to have a robots.txt, but I found this in the
terms of use:
"“Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating
to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);"
To clarify: I'm just intending to publish some graphs/visuals of which
strategies are being used. Thanks for your time!


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@maxbr0wn](https://www.kaggle.com/maxbr0wn) I believe you don't have to
scrape anything, there's an API for this kind of analysis, e.g. see
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/waechter/llm-20-questions-leaderbord-
analyze-best-agents).


### [Krens](/jickymen)
You can check it out [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-
environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/keywords.py)


### [DJ Sterling](/dster)

Indeed you can find the current "hidden set" in this way, and could again
hardcode agents against that, but note that we intend to expand the set after
the competition closes before we do the final evaluation period.


### [Pang Luo](/rcompass)
Hi [@dster](https://www.kaggle.com/dster). You mentioned "we intend to expand
the set." Could you explain what that means exactly? For instance, in the
"place" category, are you planning to add new subcategories like provinces,
states, suburbs, or even planets, besides the existing countries, cities, and
landmarks? Or are you just adding more cities and landmarks?


### [Jasper Butcher](/jasperbutcher)
Does this mean once these new keywords are released, the final test set will
be the same?


### [VassiliPh](/vassiliph)
how the current keyword list was obtained from the full future keyword list?
I could imagine at least four possible situations:
  1. Situation 1: Random sampling  
You had a full list of keywords for the future final validation you you
randlomly sampled 1000 keywords from it to make the currently used list of
keywords.  
It means we can assume that ratio of different groups (countries, cities,
mountains, rivers, houshold items, etc) in the final keyword list will be the
same as in the currently used 1000 keywords.
  2. Situation 2: Random sampling from different groups  
You had a full list of keywords for the future final validation as a list of
groups (countries, cities, mountains, rivers, houshold items, etc) and you
randomly sampled some amoung from each group to get the currently used 1000
keywords.  
It means we can assume that all main groups that will be used in the final
keyword list are represented in the current used 1000 keywords but their ratio
can be different.
  3. Situation 3: Taking some groups  
You had a full list of keywords for the future final validation as a list of
groups (countries, cities, mountains, rivers, houshold items, etc) and you
took come of those groups to get the currently used 1000 keywords.  
It means that groups used in the current keyword list will be taken as it for
the future final keyword list but some new groups can be added.
  4. Situation 4: Soemthing else
Thank you for answering, this information is indeed critically important to
design any reasonable solution.


### [riju3107](/riju3107)
Hey wanted to ask, what are we guessing? Is it limited to places and
locations? or are we guessing people? This would be helpful for designing the
chatbot.


### [Marcel0.](/marceloluizgonalves)
When the final set of words is added and the submissions closed, will they be
accessible on the keyword.py file? If so, even if I couldn't modify my code, I
could build it to consider only the possibilities in this file.


### [Naive Experimentalist](/kowjan1)
As per my understanding the hidden set of keywords will not be accessible on
the keyword. However as more and more people doubt, it is more and more
important to answer it clearly by Kaggle team. Their answer may have a great
impact on how people implement their solutions.


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff
No, they will not be accessible in the keywords.py file


### [sayoulala](/sayoulala)
Let me confirm my understanding: this means we will not have access to the
final keywords, but the final keywords come from the same source as the
current leaderboard keywords, correct?


### [Muhammad](/hark99)
Can we consider the Temple, Effil Tower, Pyramids, etc as a place?


### [Matthew S Farmer](/matthewsfarmer)
Will 'person' be added as a category at some point?


### [Matthew S Farmer](/matthewsfarmer)
Nevermind, I saw this answered elsewhere.


### [Naive Experimentalist](/kowjan1)
What answer have you found? As per my observation, persons appear in the
competition, despite it has been said they would not.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
I saw your discussion about this is just a typo or mistake


### [Naufal Muhammad dzaka](/naufalmuhammaddzaka)
thank you
