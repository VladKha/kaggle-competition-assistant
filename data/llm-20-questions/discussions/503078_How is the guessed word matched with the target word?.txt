### How is the guessed word matched with the target word?
Is there any normalization (lowercase, remove certain characters)?
Does it need to be an exact match?
If it is a word that has many similar forms (jump, jumped, jumping, etc.), do
you have to get the exact word to get it right?

Hello,
In `llm_20_questions.py` I found this function that do the normalization:
    
    
    def keyword_guessed(guess: str) -> bool:
        def normalize(s: str) -> str:
          t = str.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation)
          return s.lower().replace("the", "").replace(" ", "").translate(t)
    
        if normalize(guess) == normalize(keyword):
          return True
        for s in alts:
          if normalize(s) == normalize(guess):
            return True
    
        return False
    
    
    content_copy
In `keywords.py` we can see that some keyword have a alternative valid answer
example:
    
    
    {
            "keyword": "congo",
            "alts": ["republic of the congo", "congo brazzaville", "congo republic"]
          }
    
    
    content_copy
Hope this help!

You can always ask whether the word is lowercase for example ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
