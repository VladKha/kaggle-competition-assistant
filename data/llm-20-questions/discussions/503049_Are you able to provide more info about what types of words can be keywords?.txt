### Are you able to provide more info about what types of words can be
keywords?
It's common for animals and physical objects (e.g. pencil) to be keywords, but
could concepts like "justice" or random verbs like "jump" be options for the
keyword?
edit: I see in your code you say, "The keyword is a specific person, place, or
thing."
Is the list of keywords and categories in
[keywords.py](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/data)
exhaustive?
Why are there keywords that are multiple words?
    
    
    "keyword": "washington dc",
    "alts": ["washington dc"]

I can answer the 2nd part.
Why are there keywords that are multiple words?
I think the focus is, multiple words can mean one thing, one idea, one
concept. A name of a country may have multiple words but it represents a
single nation.


### [Nicholas Broad](/nbroad)
Sure, I just think the phrasing in the rules (“guess the secret word”) implies
that it will be a single word. I’d prefer if it said “guess the secret
word(s)”


### [G John Rao](/jaejohn)
Yeahh, but the focus should be on, one word can also mean multiple things. For
example, "May" could mean different things in the English language. This
competition goes deeper, a lot deeper.


### [Duke Silver](/maximilianmcdonough)
wondering if just the main keyword is passed to the lmm and the others are
just answers that are also acceptable, or are all of them given to the lmm?

From EDA on the interface [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rturley/run-
debug-llm-20-questions-in-a-notebook) (and my own local work), our answerer
bot only gets the main keyword.

Are you able to comment on this?

Keywords will always be a person, place or thing. We are strongly considering
adding more keywords / categories in keywords.py during the competition. After
the submission deadline we'll use a new, unpublished keyword list that agents
will not have access to.
Let me know if you have other questions!
