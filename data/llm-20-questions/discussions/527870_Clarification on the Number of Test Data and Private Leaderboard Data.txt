### Clarification on the Number of Test Data and Private Leaderboard Data
Hi everyone,
I wanted to confirm the calculation regarding the private leaderboard data.
Based on the information that the private leaderboard is calculated with
approximately 70% of the test data, and the latest public dataset contains
1500 instances, it seems the total number of test data instances should be
5000.
Here's the calculation:
Given:
  * Public dataset: 1500 instances (30% of the test data)
  * Private leaderboard: 70% of the test data
Using the equation:  
0.3 * total_test_data = 1500
We find:  
total_test_data = 1500 / 0.3 = 5000
Therefore, the private dataset should consist of:  
0.7 * 5000 = 3500 instances
Can someone confirm if this calculation is correct?
Thank you!

The 70% displayed on the leaderboard is probably an automatic message. I am
not sure this means we will have 3500 new keywords


### [Songling](/wolfmedal)
I think this is okay
