### A stupid proposal
As many may have noticed, the leaderboard rankings at the top are constantly
fluctuating. One might take a short break, only to return and find the
standings reshuffled.
Given that all the top contenders in the gold range are using Full Agent
Alpha, and their performance as answerers is essentially identical when
competing against each other, perhaps we could consider an alternative ranking
method.  
What if we evaluated each participant's skill as a Guesser across all keywords
instead? This approach might provide a more meaningful ranking system. ðŸ« 
(This is half a joke so don't take it seriously, I don't expect Kaggle to
change the ranking system at this stage. Just frusturated at how the ranking
heavily depends on luck; who you team up when you act as an answerer)

Andrew ( [@jademonk](https://www.kaggle.com/jademonk) ) has done a good job of
analyzing Guesser ability
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/530312).
His post illustrates that there are multiple dimensions to being a good
Guesser.

Thanks, I'll have a look

(full joke mode) - There should be a showdown of the top 10 where only the
guesser is active and all questions/answer are masked. The winner will
solidify the hypothesis that this is indeed a pseudo-lottery.

Of course it should have been on a steady cooling schedule with sigma
decreasing slowly and steadily down to a low minimum, lower than it is now,
and all this with lots of gameplay uniformly from top to bottomâ€¦ but well,
there were certain complications, and it seems we're going to have lots of
luck and bad luck involved until the end.

It seems my agent is on the right track before the finish.. ,)

### [c-number](/cnumber)
Yeah, your agent is on the right track for sure

### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@cnumber](https://www.kaggle.com/cnumber) looks like it changed tracks, also
possible!â€¦ but my point was the same as yours -- because of the relatively
high lower bound on sigma, it's just too easy to drop out after a few final
loses.


### [c-number](/cnumber)
Totally agreed. Even if there are enough games, I believe the LB will not ever
converge, because of the answerer problem.
