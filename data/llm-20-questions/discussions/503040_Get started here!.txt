Your information has been very helpful. Thank you!


### [Hadi Aman](/hadiaman)
Hi, should we create our own model, or can we use existing ones and train them
further?.


### [Muhammad Rameez242](/muhammadrameez242)
train your own model

It is taking too long for submission in the kaggle competition

We are currently trying to solve an issue with our servers. Should be sorted

### [Mohan Bhat](/mohanbhat612)
Hello, can someone please summarize the important aspects or body of this
competition its too confusing


### [Daniel Andres Miranda](/danielandresmiranda)
hi, I'm very happy to find this competition, I'm new at this and I've never
before played "20 questions".  
I want to know if in each match, we always know the category of all keywords?


### [Veekshith Rao Poleni](/veekshithraopoleni)
Hey, Im am minor interested in participating in this competition. Can someone
help me with that?


### [Naoism](/naoism)
In the overview, it says the following: So does this mean that in this
competition, we must use LLM generation for all "questions," "guesses," and
"answers"?
`Each team will consist of one guesser LLM, responsible for asking questions
and making guesses, and one answerer LLM, responsible for responding with
"yes" or "no" answers.`


### [mhericks](/mhericks)
Currently, no strict rule is enforced on this. Especially, there are agents
that hard-code part of the agent behaviour and even agents that fully rely on
non-LLM strategies (binary search on a fixed vocabulary). The rules are not
clear whether agents without a significant LLM component will be disqualified
- the challenge is called _LLM_ 20 Questions after all.


### [Yash Jadhav](/iamyashjadhav)
I tried various ways but unable to start for this competition . Can someone
explain correct way to submit and why it goes on infinite loop?


### [A. John Callegari Jr.](/ajohncallegarijr)
Can our LLM agents access the internet during competitions to, for instance,
use openai API calls?


### [David](/davidxueml)
No you cannot. The specifications have stated the submission files cannot
communicate with anything external when it’s running.


### [Saksham Sapkota](/sakshamjr10)
Nicely trained Model!


### [Muhammad Rameez242](/muhammadrameez242)
I preferred local server
