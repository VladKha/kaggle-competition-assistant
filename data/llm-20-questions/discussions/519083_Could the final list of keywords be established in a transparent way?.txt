### Could the final list of keywords be established in a transparent way?
There's plenty of speculation and uncertainty regarding the keywords, in
particular the final list of keywords. We know from announcements, that hosts
will be watching the situation and reacting appropriately to ensure fair
competition. I don't know if the list of keywords is a subject for such
appropriate adjustments, but it seems likely. In my humble opinion, reacting
to the situation on the LB in the upcoming phase of the competition
specifically by adjusting the final list of keywords would be rather unfair.
Potentially even very unfair. It would be like moving a goalpost, and
intentionally or unintentionally, favoring some solutions at the expense of
others.
Of course there's no ground to believe our hosts are not impartial, although
sometimes even impartial intent can have a partial effect. Fortunately there's
a simple way to handle this without leaving any trace of doubt and cut short
any later speculation about the conduct and the final set -- that is
**preparing the final list of keywords well before the deadline and celebrate
the occasion by announcing the hash key of the final list** (e.g. SHA256 or
any other.) This way everybody could rest assured that the final list was not
influenced by any hot situation on the LB shortly before the deadline or any
particular final solutions submitted. It would also reassure everybody
beforehand that the list is ready and final, and so they don't need to worry
about any last minute changes. Also giving an opportunity to describe the
final list in a manner fair to everyone.
Certainly I don't want to be alone in this call, so please give it a reaction
if you agree, I'm sure our hosts would consider it more seriously then.. ,)

Just a beginner hereâ€¦but as someone who took a lot of time to learn about LLMs
just to even try and compete here, it is a bit disappointing seeing all the
top LB models have the questions and keywords guesses hard coded and not
really using LLMs. But I am in no way going for the top spots just was
surprised since the title is "LLM 20 Questions" I was assuming LLMs. Still
learning a lot through the shared notebooks so thanks all!


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@valentinbaltazar](https://www.kaggle.com/valentinbaltazar) Although that's
another story, don't worry, as far as I know, LLMs are still very useful.
Especially when used creatively and mixed with other approaches. Just point
yourself in the direction of your dreams. Find your strength in the sound, and
make your [transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqdrtzCaSHw).


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
I am not sure if I understand your point do you mean to say that the hosts
should show us the list of private LB keywords?


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@max1mum](https://www.kaggle.com/max1mum) No, of course not to show, but just
to establish it well before the deadline in a way that would rule out any
possibility of influence from the LB. I think the situation may get hot
shortly before the deadline and if the list of keywords is still an open
matter then it may get unpleasantly messy.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
I beleive that this would make the competition worse for example if someone
finds an unfair or "unusual" strategy he keywords can be changed to remove
this competitor.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@max1mum](https://www.kaggle.com/max1mum) I'm surprised anyone could think
that "unusual" strategies would be unfairâ€¦ ;) â€¦ as far as I know there are no
rules about allowed or disallowed strategies (except private sharing,
collusion, etc.) So actually changing the keywords in response to a particular
strategy would be unfair. I don't believe hosts would ever consider such a
move, nevertheless there is a possibility of being influenced by the
situation.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
I have a feeling I know what strategy you want to use for private LB ðŸ«£


### [Van Mason](/vanmason)
As far as â€˜unusualâ€™ strategies go, I would say a binary search agent or an
agent that simply knows all the keywords prior does not seem very in the
spirit of the competition and these agents might benefit more than an LLM from
an unchanging keyword list.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
This is true that is why private LB needs to be different than public. Not
pointing fingers but [@lohmaa](https://www.kaggle.com/lohmaa) is one of the
forebearers of such a strategy, but their is one way to adapt it for private
LB ðŸ˜‰


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@max1mum](https://www.kaggle.com/max1mum) You make it sound like it was some
kind of cheat. No it's not, it's not against the rules, it's just a non-LLM
solution. I've published it and explained why I think it's good to use it. You
can use it too, totally up to you.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
I am not at all calling it a cheat it just relies on other people using it. It
is just one of the "unusual" strategies since it not only benefits one person
but all that use it together. The way you made it will not work on private LB
so it is a bit "unfair" as it fills the public LB with spoof/fake scores that
will not reflect the private LB. I totally agree it is legal it is just like
an extremely "overfitted" code. I also believe alpha is a very good idea
strictly for public LB.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@max1mum](https://www.kaggle.com/max1mum) The whole competition has a crucial
social and communication factor. Your agent's performance depends on how well
it can communicate with others, not how smart it is in isolation. But I
totally understand your skepticism. To speak bluntlyâ€¦ what if I could prove
you wrong? That is, if you didn't change the keywords after seeing my final
solutionâ€¦ ;) That's my request speaking bluntly. It's a request for
transparency, although I'm not sure if you can see it that way. Perhaps some
people would think that I'm trying dirty tricks for my own benefit. Let them
be. I'm not asking to see the keywords -- I think that would surely mean I'm a
lunatic, no? If you read my post, I'm asking to "finalize" the list of
keywords before players start submitting their final solutions. Because
exactly changing the list of keywords in response to those solutions would be
unfair. Who knows, maybe we're even going to hear calls like "Oh! That's
unfair! That terrible strategy is unfairly beating decent players who honestly
are trying to squeeze out LLMs! We have to change the list of keywords!"
hahaha.. I'm exaggerating obviously.. no hard feelings^^


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Again I believe that I know your idea for the final submission and if it is
what I think it is I have already done it and have it ready to launch from my
local. I don't see any problem with your code other than a slight, slight
"teaming" problem and I fully understand it is a totally fair and respectable
agent. I also think that if the Kaggle team can give us a pre-made hash code
for the output then that would be preferable. However, I am not sure if the
Kaggle team is fully done with the private LB, since the second objects-
included set of keywords had a 2-3 week delay. But only time will tell. I will
second this request for transparency if and only if there is:  
1) No way to get the final keyword set ahead of time  
2) The current keywords will NOT be included in the final list
