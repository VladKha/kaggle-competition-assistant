### Biasness in Game Play 😏
Some of the players played more than **40 games** in last **10 hours** and
some played just **4 games**.

It seems that top rank teams get more plays, to make them converge. I was at
the top then kicked out immediately after few games.
Low rank agents get fewer plays, but score grows faster

I feel like no one got a fair chance to play in this competition from day 1
because of the poor game environment.

They are mainly focused on converging the agents to their proper rank. I was
sitting at 720+ place pairing with agent that only answers no with score <400
or less. Now both of my agents converge to the same score with one of them
scored 400 the day before yesterday.
