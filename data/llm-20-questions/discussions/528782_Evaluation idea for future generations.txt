### Evaluation idea for future generations
It seems the evaluation is hugely ineffective. Around 97% of games end in a
tie, and the score update is based solely on the differences in the current
scores, but these updates do not reflect the outcome of the game. Score update
based on previous scores not outcomes, is just smoothing things out, not
really incorporating new information, no good.
Basically the evaluation is inefficient, and we're going to have trivial
convergence rather than true convergence.
Could this be improved in future? Very likely. Measure the distance between
the keyword and all the gueses (or the final guess) in a semantic space (i.e.
word vectors) and award "minor points" based on this. Very efficient way to
make a difference between a "close shot" and "absolutely no clue". Most of the
matches would bring meaningful information about the performance.
Side effects? Alphabetic search is likely to be at disadvantage here.

There is a huge problem with similarity in semantic space. It is useful as a
part of a pipeline like RAG (retrieval augmented generation), but as metric
it's much too hackable. Look at the LLM prompt recovery challenge. They used
semantic similarity as evaluation metric there and almost everything people
did was write better mean prompts instead of actually solving the task
The best mean prompt was good enough to get gold:

That's interesting, thanks for sharing, maybe my idea isn't so good then…  
although I will try to understand better before I give it up.. because maybe
it was hackable in the context of that specific competition, while it could be
more reliable when it comes to short words and phrases.

What do we want to measure : the ability to guess a word in 20 questions or
less.
Simplest and fairiest metric ever : number of correct guesses over number of
played games, possibly weighted by a function of the number of rounds.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
I agree it's the simplest, but as we can observe it is hugely inefficient and
in consequence, the convergence will be proportionally poor.
