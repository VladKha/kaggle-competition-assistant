### debug error [ERR]
just joined the competition now and ran the LLama 8B notebook as a test
submission. It works fine until one round where the agent gets penalized with
**-237** in one round.
The replay works fine until the very end and the agent logs don't show
anything ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Did anyone encounter this issue too or knows ways to debug this?
