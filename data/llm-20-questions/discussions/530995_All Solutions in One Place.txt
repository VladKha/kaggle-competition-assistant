the list.
Regardless of the result, sharing your solution is an opportunity for both you
and everyone else to learn. I’ve always made it a point to share my solution,
even when I wasn’t in the medal zone! I’m looking forward to seeing everyone’s
solutions!
Let’s keep learning from each other’s experiences!
**How to register your solution:**
