### The Kaggle "LLM 20 Questions Starter Notebook" Fails
All I did was clone the notebook; save it; and hit submit. And it fails… Any
ideas why?

Hi [@marketneutral](https://www.kaggle.com/marketneutral), You'll need to
submit the output of the notebook instead of the notebook itself. Check out
the first cell of the notebook for more details.

Ok. Got it. Thank you. I tried that. It still errors. The log file:

Has anyone been able to submit the Kaggle baseline agents?


### [jazivxt](/jazivxt)
Yes, just submitted successfully.


### [marketneutral](/marketneutral)
Any secrets to getting this to work? All I am doing is cloning the notebook,
running it, downloading the output compressed submission file; uploading it as
as a submission.


### [marketneutral](/marketneutral)
I think I may have figured it out. I see this notice now

Which is a little cryptic to be honest. I looked at the Models panel in the nb
and see nothing to do

However I think I solved it. You have to accept the license on the Gemma
Models tab from the homepage.


### [Benjamin Maréchal](/irmo322)
Thank you. I had the same issue.  
For those who wonder where you have to go for accepting the licence, search
Gemma in kaggle models.
