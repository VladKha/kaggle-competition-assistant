### Agent interface
Is there some kind of agent interface we can implement? Right now it's kinda
unclear how this whole competition works.

Have you seen pinned notebook ?

Yes, I've seen it, but it's a bit hard to parse what is the minimal
requirement and where the entry point is etc. But I found some usefull
information hidden away in the submission modal. Basically the last function
of your main.py file should take an observation and return the response. - I
think that is important information and shouldn't have been hidden away like
that.

Apologies, and yes, the entry point is the last function of main.py


### [monkeyHyx](/monkeyhyx)
So in each step the function will be newly executed?  
can it be something like a function inside a class?
