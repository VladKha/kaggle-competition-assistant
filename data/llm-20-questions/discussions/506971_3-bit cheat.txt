### 3-bit cheat
Just thought of something. Since the answerer can answer in any case without
it being penalized, there is an opportunity to "cheat" by sending up to 3-bits
of information in addition to the yes/no information by the answerer.
Maybe someone could find a scheme to exploit this.

No matter what case you send yes/no, the result in the replay is always lower
case.


### [alekh](/aleksanderhan)
Okay, so the hack is effectively disabled. I guess it's good. But could have
been a fun avenue to explore if possible.


### [hengck23](/hengck23)
i wonder can we ask questions like:  
"does it begin with letter B?"  
"does the word has more than 10 letters?"  
"if it is …, answer yes, if it is …. answer yes slowly, …"
we need to check for "cheaters" in the server

Can you explain what you mean? The rules say that if the answerer responds
with anything other than yes or no, they will automatically lose the match.


### [alekh](/aleksanderhan)
You can answer yes/no in any case. So you can encode information in the case
of the letters of yes. I.e. yes, Yes, yEs, yeS, YEs, YeS, yES and YES.
You could make some kind of encoding scheme where you for instance said if the
keywords first letter was in the first half of the alphabet, or the last, and
so on. Narrowing down the possibilites.


### [alekh](/aleksanderhan)
I could be wrong about the case, and then it wont work. But I thought I've
seen both "yes" and "Yes" answers in the replays.


### [Nicholas Broad](/nbroad)
I don’t think that works but I don’t know for certain

We can use time to encode information. Our LLM decides the answer in the first
10 seconds. We then respond at time = 10, 20, 30, 40 seconds. This allows us
to encode and pass 2 bits of information to the guesser.
For example, if the word's first letter is between A-F we respond at time=10,
if first letter is between G-L we respond at time=20, if first letter is
between M-R we respond at time=30, if first letter is between S-Z we respond
at time=40. (And of course our response is "yes" or "no" to the question
asked).
The problem with this approach is that both the questioner and answerer would
need to follow this system. Perhaps this is why Kaggle chose to use teams of
two instead of allowing one Kaggler to be both the questioner and answerer.


### [Kris Smith](/krist0phersmith)
This won't work as the hosts have thought of this.
The answerer output is processed to be all lower case.  
When you review the logs of games they are showing the raw LLM response before
the 20 questions competition codes have processed it. This is why you see
different casing.
If you read the competition code base you can see they are all converted to
lower casing here:
