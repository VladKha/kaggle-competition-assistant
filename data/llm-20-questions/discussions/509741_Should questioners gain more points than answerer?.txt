### Should questioners gain more points than answerer?
The questioner is undoubtedly more important and most of our development will
be in the questioner, not the answerer.
A good questioner can be also good if it is not susceptible by the answerer’s
noise.
I think giving a weighted point distribution is more reasonable. For clear:
when winning with a correct guess (not by winning by the opponent’s error),
the questioner should be given more points than the answerer.

i don't think so, the answerer may seem less important if we count the number
of words it should produce (yes/no), but in reality, it does much more than
that, it should understand the question first, make a comparison in its
"head", then decide.  
it's like the answerer have to be a good in comparison, and the questioner
have to make good deductions.

Not so easy. Both play crucial role. No matter how good you are in asking
question but if questioner hallucinate no luck for you. One of the big issues
i see I try to solve is that llm are not good in answering questions does word
contain letter. So i think it team game and both are equal
