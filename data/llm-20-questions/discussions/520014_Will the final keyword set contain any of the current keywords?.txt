### Will the final keyword set contain any of the current keywords?
I was wondering this since most successful methods exclusively use the keyword
set and would fail horribly if none of the current keywords were in the final
test set - e.g. bots which use lexicographical ordering (does the kw come
before 'x' in alphabetical order etc.) rely exclusively on having access to
such words beforehand.
I personally think these are far less interesting than using LLMs or other
methods - you could simply write a bunch of checks see which type of such pre-
built question is being asked and the competition wouldn't require any LLMs to
be used…

Yea, from what I can see all the top LB models are not really using an LLM for
questions….they just have some list of fixed questions that they repeat every
time with deterministic guesses from the known keywords.py list. If they
release the full set then they will just add those words to their list and
yea…no LLM needed.
