### Understanding
I am still trying to understand the theme of this competetion. How I can get
the data and how to submit it. Little bit confusing here. Hope someone can
clear me out a bit.

this competition we not submmit the predict result, but a robot, a
s`ubmission.tar.gz` you can check the starter notebook.
My understanding is all the agent bot we submmit will play the 20 question
game together, and find the winner bot. On the Leaderboard, there is a button
show you how the agent bot play the game.

Thank. you for your information. I think I will submit to the competition. It
will be my first time to do it. But before let me check the starter code.
