### End of competition submission bug (Error logs: Page not found)
In my last week I had many errors in my code and the day before submission I
finally fixed all of them. However, when I submit the agent I get an error
that says page not found. I have had this error before and I think this
happens because of too many submissions at one time. This made it so that my
new and good submission that errors out unfairly is not counted however one of
my old submissions that errors out in the code sometimes and is bad does not
count. I was one of the first people in this competition and spent an entire 3
months in this competition, but I was basically thrown out of the competition.
I have counted my number of submissions in total and it is 342, which just
shows how much time I have spent on this competition. This is incredibly
unfair to me (and I believe others have had this problem too) and a waste of
countless hours spent on this competition. I know that there is likely nothing
the competition owners can do anymore, but I advise Kaggle to be more careful
when the competition has this many submissions at a time.

this?

You tried to submit just before midnight, got the error and the deadline had
passed before you could try again? Sounds like a nightmare scenario after
months of work… although look, those "technical blackouts" could be easily
anticipated on the final day… Too bad you couldn't fix it earlier, but who
knows, maybe it's gonna be OK, good luck^^
