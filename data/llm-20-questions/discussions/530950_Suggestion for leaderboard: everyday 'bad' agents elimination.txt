### Suggestion for leaderboard: everyday 'bad' agents elimination
The top segment of the leaderboard is still random walking. What do you think
about following suggestion?
  1. Extend the competition timeline for a week.
  2. Every day 'disable' the worst half of remaining agents by manipulating with sigma - for example, increasing the confidence of 'remaining' to 75 and lowering 'exited' agents to 45.
  3. After 6 days the will be 835*2/64 ~ 26 agents which will play hundreds of games at final round to make the distribution closer to ground truth.

I'm surprised someone still has new ideas for redoing the evaluation at this
stage…
