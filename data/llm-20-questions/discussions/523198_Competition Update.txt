### Competition Update
Hey all,
Here is an update on what to expect from the final weeks of the competition.
  * Active agents reduced from 3 to 2 (starting this week, which will increase the game rate)
  * Question character length limit reduced from 2000 to 750 (the extra character limit was unused other than for “binary search” type questions)
  * Remove “Locations” from the keyword set. (starting this week, the “locations” problem space it too small)
When the competition closes:
  * The unseen secret “things” keyword list will be swapped in
  * The leaderboard will be reset
  * The post-evaluation period will start at 2 weeks, but will likely be extended.
Thank you all for participating! This competition is the first of its kind and
we appreciate your patience while we learned along the way. We’ll take what we
learned in this competition to make future competitions even better!
Happy Kaggling!
Bovard
EDIT:  
On the secret "things" keyword list
  * it is taken from roughly same keyword list as the current list. 
  * it will not re-use any of the current words in the keyword list
  * it will _not_ be accessible in keywords.py

Hi [@addisonhoward](https://www.kaggle.com/addisonhoward)
[@mylesoneill](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) . In Kaggle's post above, Kaggle says
that the `[Private LB] will not re-use any of the current words in the [Public
LB] keyword list`. Here is a screenshot quote from above:  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdeotte/Kaggle_Images/main/Aug-2024/not-
use.png)  
Kaggle also says this in a comment below
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/523198\)#2954374).
Here is a screenshot quote:  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cdeotte/Kaggle_Images/main/Aug-2024/not-
use2.png)  
Kagglers have analyzed the Private LB keyword list and determined that `7.7%
of the [Private LB] keywords are re-use of the current [Public LB] words`. Ten
Kagglers have pointed this out in the discussion
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/527853)
and those posts have received 200+ upvotes. Kaggle has still not responded, so
I'm bringing this issue to your attention. It would be great if you responded!
Analysis is published
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/529115).
Is this the intended behavior of the Private LB or is there something wrong?

Will either the singlular or plural form of a word be accepted?


### [techniquetwice](/techniquetwice)
Hi [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) ,  
Will each agents get to play the same number of times?


### [KKY](/evilpsycho42)
Can we ensure that the new set of keywords does not include any existing
keywords?


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)

> it will not re-use any of the current words in the keyword list


### [NIWATORI](/niwatori)
Hi [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard), Does "the current words in the
keyword list" mean the keywords used in the current evaluation, i.e., the
combination of the keywords from
[keywords.py](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-
environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/keywords.py)
and the hidden keywords, which can be found in the ongoing replays?
Also, does it mean an exact match, or does it also include matches based on
alt in the keywords.py and [compare](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-
environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/llm_20_questions.py#L304)?
For example, we find `{"keyword": "Air Conditioner", "alts": ["Air
Conditioning"]}` in the keywords.py, so not only "Air Conditioner", but also
"airconditioner", "airconditioning", "Air conditioner", and so on will not be
included as well in the final keyword list and their alt? More formally, a
keyword `k` which satisfies `compare_words(k, k0)` with any `k0` in the
current keyword list will not be included?


### [Andrei Chernov](/chernovandrey1998)
Hello! I still see in today's simulations locations keyword, namely Norway.
Are you going to exclude locations or not?
Thank you for your clarification!


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff
They will be removed shortly, thanks!


### [Neuron Engineer](/ratthachat)
As of today, August 9, I still face the keyword 'Australia' , am I missing
something [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) ?

### [Sadhaklal](/sambitmukherjee)
Factually incorrect answers by bad agents are derailing high quality agents.
After optimising my prompts, I’m able to get 54% success rate with GPT-4o (in
self-play mode) and 21% success rate with Llama 3.1 (in self-play mode). After
fine-tuning Llama 3.1, I’m able to get 49% success rate (in self-play mode) ->
on unseen keywords ("places" + "things" combined).
I think my agent is pretty good. But it depends on the answers being factually
correct. Factually incorrect answers are derailing the agent completely.
I think it would have been better if Kaggle replaced the cooperative structure
of this competition with a fixed answerer LLM that gave factually correct
answers (at least most of the time). This would make the competition be about
(1) asking good questions & (2) making good guesses, not about navigating a
highly noisy environment.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
Hi [@sambitmukherjee](https://www.kaggle.com/sambitmukherjee) unreliable
answers are part of the game and I'm sure many people account for that in
their solutions. It's hard to imagine anyone responsible could seriously
consider changing the game to fit the characteristic of your solution.. ,)


### [Sadhaklal](/sambitmukherjee)
I'm sceptical that many people are "accounting for unreliable answers".
I'm willing to bet that in the vast majority of cases, an LLM won't get the
guess correct if the "yes" / "no" answers it receives are factually incorrect.
I believe the end objective of this competition is to teach an LLM to play 20
questions. It's not to teach an LLM how to navigate a highly noisy
environment.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
OK, actually I don't know how many but I bet more than a few… surely we can
also bet the guess rate won't be high, and I don't know what's the end
objective, actually I don't think it matters, what matter is to get a good
performance in the game as it is, not to change the game mid-air… I don't know
if you noticed, but there were dozens of proposals to change the game for
various reasons (including my own suggestions long time ago.) I can't imagine
the mess had they been implemented… ,)


### [Sadhaklal](/sambitmukherjee)
I don’t actually expect the competition to be changed this late. Hence, please
don’t treat my original comment as a lobbying effort.
I’m just voicing my concern & frustration about the noisy environment.


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
Bad answerers are interacting with everybody, not just your bot. It’s part of
the game and it’s fair to everyone.


### [Sadhaklal](/sambitmukherjee)
Yeah but it’s ruining the fun of the competition. Imagine showing these game
replays to non machine learning folks. The games look ridiculous.
As far as fairness is concerned, I don’t have a problem with bad answerers, as
long as a sufficiently large number of games are played in the private
keywords phase of the competition.


### [Mahmoud Elshahed](/letemoin)
in fact Providing a fixed answer agent by contest "in future development or
releases" is pretty smart idea. it will give all the same equal opportunity.


### [Ariocx](/ariocx)
So keywords can only be “things”？


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff
yes, that is correct


### [Gavin Cao](/gavinxgcao)
Then will obs.category be all "things" or empty or have new subcategories
within things?


### [BORAHMLEE](/borahmlee)
Hi, Do you use purely secret keywords in your final evaluation? Or do you
combine them with current keywords to make the evaluation?


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff

Purely secret keywords


### [BORAHMLEE](/borahmlee)
> Purely secret keywords
Thanks for your comment!

I noticed that the number of active agents is already 2, but I still see
locations appearing in the keywords. Will they still be removed or is it a
mistake in the removal?


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
Hi [@marceloluizgonalves](https://www.kaggle.com/marceloluizgonalves) ,  
`Remove “Locations” from the keyword set. (starting this week, the “locations”
problem space it too small)`  
`starting this week` means it will be removed from the start of the final 14
days, not the current lb.


### [Marcel0.](/marceloluizgonalves)
If that were the case, the number of agents should not have been already
reduced.


### [Fayez Siddiqui](/fayezsiddiqui)
I agree with
[@marceloluizgonalves](https://www.kaggle.com/marceloluizgonalves) here i also
launched an agent with specific instructions to not guess place 😭😂


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard), is a problem will be solved in the
final lb?


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff

locations have been removed


### [Nicholas Broad](/nbroad)
Is [this
comment](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/512358#2872495)
no longer relevant?

### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff

Yes, that will no longer be the case.


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
[@Hi](https://www.kaggle.com/Hi) [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) ,  
`Remove “Locations” from the keyword set. (starting this week, the “locations”
problem space it too small)`
That means in private keywords, the keywords will not have `locations(place,
landmark, mountain, river...)` and only `thing` keywords, right?  
Then agents reduced from 3 -> 2, is it keep 2 newest agents or 2 highest score
agents?


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff
Yes, keep only the "things" keywords.
It will be the 2 newest agents


### [Andrew Tratz](/jademonk)
A suggestion, for this or for other simulations in the future: allow
participants to permanently inactivate specific bots, reducing their bot quota
usage. This way, there's no need to inactivate high-scoring bots in order to
continue experimenting, and if they are permanently disabled then there's no
risk of anyone sandbagging by temporarily disabling and later re-enabling a
strong bot. I think this would create a more robust competition with few
downsides.


### [Fayez Siddiqui](/fayezsiddiqui)
Great suggestion, I also think having the freedom of Agent selection would be
great.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Not a good idea as people could just enable a high-scoring old agent


### [Fayez Siddiqui](/fayezsiddiqui)
how about letting you enable and disable agents only from your daily
submissions only recent 5 [@max1mum](https://www.kaggle.com/max1mum)


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
This would fix the previous issue but why would this be useful and it would be
hard for the kaggle devs to implement this.


### [Fayez Siddiqui](/fayezsiddiqui)
I think most of the people stop to experiment after getting a good score as
most of the leaderboard top scorers haven't updated their Agents for a long
time. But with such changes the competition might become more engaging. Also
you can always resubmit your high scoring old agent again by going to that
notebooks outputs and submitting the files. I have tried so I am pretty sure


### [gguillard](/gguillard)
I don't get what's wrong about re-enabling your best submission, just like in
other competitions, what point am I missing ?


### [Bhanu Prakash M](/bhanupm)
Are all the items in the things category physical objects?  
Can I rule out the possibility of there being virtual or abstract things?


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff
The current list of words is roughly representative of the final list.


### [Tran Anh Quan](/trananhquan)
So in the final leaderboard are there only “Things” keywords used for
evaluation? Will there be no “Person” or “Place” keywords at all?


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff

yes, only "things"


### [hayate_taf](/hayatetaf)
One of the two agents we had running a few days ago was disabled with the end
of the competition.  
I was under the understanding that there were two models that could be
submitted, am I wrong?  
If correct, I would like to have the agent I was running reinstated.


### [Jacky285](/jacky285)
For the final evaluation, the number of agents are still 3 right?


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff
no, only 2


### [Jacky285](/jacky285)
May I ask how many categories will the keyword set contain? And will the all
the keywords be available to the agent when playing?


### [Songling](/wolfmedal)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) I have a question. I just saw the
final evaluation and update of the competition. The number of cancelled agents
is reduced to 2. So will there be 2 active agents entering the evaluation or
3?


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff
2 active agents during the evaluation


### [skhan kim](/skhankim)
Hi [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard),  
Are the new secret keywords(final list) semantically similar to the current
keywords?  
I'm confused about the meaning of 'The current list of words is roughly
representative of the final list.'🤔


### [Fayez Siddiqui](/fayezsiddiqui)
I think they are broadly from the same categories is what he wants to say


### [yuanzhe zhou](/yuanzhezhou)
why are there too many nans


### [Fayez Siddiqui](/fayezsiddiqui)
I am confused too but i think its due to some error on the agents end


### [francesco fiamingo](/francescofiamingo)
Thanks a lot! I think we are building the best community in the world, amazed
to be part of it, one technical question , i need to decide to merge with
other teams, if i will do, how many agents the team can use? 2 per component
of the team or two for whole team?


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
I guess we will have only have 2 agents for whole team.


### [francesco fiamingo](/francescofiamingo)
Wow…but this means that is better not to merge….


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
As author said  
`Active agents reduced from 3 to 2 (starting this week, which will increase
the game rate)`  
assume if we have 10 agents for team 5 members, maybe game rate will divide
from 2 agents to 10 agents, It also means less opportunity for each agent.


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff
Only 2 agents per team. Once you merge together two teams they only count as a
single team so they would only have 2 active agents


### [FullEmpty](/gowillgo)
Thank you for your update. I've walked through discussions, but this doesn't
seem to be discussed.
> Questions are limited to ~~2000~~ 750 characters  
>  Guesses are limited to 100 characters
Is the limit applied per round or for total questions throughout the rounds?
> Agents are given 60 seconds per round to answer  
>  Agents have an additional 300 overage seconds to use throughout the game
I think this means each of the questioning/guessing agent and the answering
agent has 60 seconds. But when does the 60 seconds for the
questioning/guessing agent start — at the point when the round begins, when
the agent asks a question, or right after the answering agent responds for
guessing?


### [FullEmpty](/gowillgo)
Can anyone help???


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
Hi [@gowillgo](https://www.kaggle.com/gowillgo) ,
    
    
    Questions are limited to 2000 750 characters
    Guesses are limited to 100 characters
    
    
    content_copy
it apply for each question, and each guess, not cumulative across entire game.
then game work as below:
**60s first - agent 1(ask/guess)**
  * load model(only in step 1, ~40s for model 8b 8bit)
  * return first question
  * if > 60s, subtract to budget 300s  
-> agent 1 stop  
**immediately count 60s of agent 2(answer)**
  * load model(~40s)
  * answer question or anything you want
  * if > 60s, subtract to budget 300s  
-> agent 2 stop  
**immediately count 60s of agent 1(ask/guess)**
  * return guess(model was load in step 1)  
…


### [FullEmpty](/gowillgo)
[@pnmanh2123](https://www.kaggle.com/pnmanh2123) That's so crisp clear to
understand - many thanks!!!


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
You are welcome!
