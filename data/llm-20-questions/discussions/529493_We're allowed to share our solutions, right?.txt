### We're allowed to share our solutions, right?
Almost nobody has shared their solutions yet, but since the submission
deadline has passed, we're allowed to share our solutions, right?  
Just want to make sure before making my solution public.
(By the way, I did WAY MORE than just googling for a dataset with English
words to use it for the binary search algorithm, although it may not be clear
from the current LB)

### [c-number](/cnumber)
Thanks everyone, I'll start writing my solution. Hopefully it'll be public by
the end of the week.


### [c-number](/cnumber)
Maybe it will be late because I have to prepare for the USPTO winner's call…


### [c-number](/cnumber)
(Just for those who care, winner's call finished yesterday, so I'm currently
writing the solution)


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Yes, we can share our solutions. I am looking forward to reading about your
solution C-Number.


### [KKY](/evilpsycho42)
It's great to learn some top solutions such as yours while waiting for the
final result.


### [Ilmari Vahteristo](/ilmarivahteristo)
Looking at some of your games, your solution looks very impressive in many
games! I hope we only get good solutions to the Top-5, and not lucky
submissions.


### [Andrew Tratz](/jademonk)
In prior simulation competitions people started sharing immediately after
submissions closed. Don't know why this competition would be any different.


### [ISAKA Tsuyoshi](/isakatsuyoshi)
I'm looking forward to seeing everyone's solutions! I also plan to share my
solution and contribute to the community.

Would it be okay to share the source code (on Kaggle, GitHub) and the dataset?


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff

Definitely!


### [VolodymyrBilyachat](/vovikdrg)
How to make it public before competition ends?


### [wasjaip](/wasjaip)
An excellent, robust model. I would really like to take a look at the
approach!
