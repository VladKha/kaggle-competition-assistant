### [Offtopic] What got the LB moving
If anyone is interested, I think the LB got moving from all 600.0 because of
this lucky game where the keyword was "france". ðŸ˜€ It is the only non-tied game
I have seen this far.

Lucky, because the example notebook uses "france" in its few_shot_examples,
which I guess primed the bot.

Wait so all of our agent's questions and answers are public? Does that spoil
the whole strategy?

We can, yes, but I don't see how that matters much -- the game seems too
complex to actually "game".  
They wouldn't still know how you came to your answers + the keywords will
(hopefully) come from a large pool, so creating a lookup table or something
like that would be quite costly; you couldn't do it offline unless people
submit totally barebones LLM solutions (you would also have to do that for
each of many opponents).  
Also, from what I have seen this far, one might want to query an LLM many
times per game turn to fix bad answers etc. (gemma-7b for example does not
seem to play the game well out-of-the-box). All of those internal "moves"
would still be hidden.
