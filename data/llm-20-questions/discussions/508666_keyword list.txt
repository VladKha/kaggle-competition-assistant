Do I understand correctly that after July 7, the keywords.py file will be

Where do you see the date July 7th?
> August 13, 2024 - Final Submission Deadline.  
>  August 13, 2024- August 27, 2024 - Estimated range when final games are
> played.  
>  August 28, 2024 - Winners announced.
It is the case that the keyword list will change on August 13th. Afterward,
our bots will **not** have access to the list.

currently using just prompt engineering to solve the problem. I'm considering
the feasibility of fine-tune. For example, extracting quality dialogue from
