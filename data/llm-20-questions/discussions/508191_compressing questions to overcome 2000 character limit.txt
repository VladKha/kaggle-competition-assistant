### compressing questions to overcome 2000 character limit
I just joined the competition and haven't gotten my hands dirty with any code.
I could be misunderstanding the problem but shouldn't it be possible to
compress information for example the first thing that comes to mind is using
something like camel case to get rid of spaces in questions to make the 2000
characters go further. It seems like a good approach would be to not confine
the bots to play like a humans would. I could be totally wrong though would
love to hear what everyone thinks.

There are many creative ideas to achieve more with questions. However the
format of the competition is two Kaggle teams versus two Kaggle teams and this
limits us.
Each team has a "questioner" and "answerer". If we invent a new language where
the words are 50% shorter, then we can increase the information per question
by 2x. However the "answerer" will not understand our new language. Therefore
the format of the competition prevents "questioners" from doing anything too
untypical.

yes that totally makes sense now I was misunderstanding how it was set up.
