### Don't forget to accept gemma license
I came across a hurdle while trying out the LLM 20 Questions Starter Notebook
on Kaggle. My submission file ended up being only 11MB, way smaller than the
expected 7GB+.
There was actually a message hinting at the issue: "An attached model requires
additional steps to be accessed. See the Models panel for details."
Turns out, if you want to use the Gemma model, you need to head over to the
Kaggle Models section, find Gemma, accept the license agreement, and then
it'll be available for use!
Thanks to [@irmo322](https://www.kaggle.com/irmo322) and
