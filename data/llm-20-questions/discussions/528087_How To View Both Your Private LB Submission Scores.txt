Reminder, if you want to see the progress of **both** your Private LB
submissions, use the link in this discussion post.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
It looks like the private LB has begun running episodes. The scores are
changing and we can view the episodes by clicking the link in this discussion
and viewing our submissions. Good luck everyone!

They will restart the LB once again due to wrong keyword list, per Bovard
(Kaggle).

Where was it mentioned, I cant find the reply or announcement.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)

Thank you, I think this confirms the concerns that some people had.  
Which submissions will be used for the private LB even though it makes sense
that the two latest submissions would be used.


### [KKY](/evilpsycho42)
Kaggler can always find a way!

Wow, this was what I did to take the screenshot yesterday and posted it
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/527853#2958429),
after the time was up.
I didn't share it yesterday because I assumed it was a "hacky" way and thought
the devs would make a better way to view it haha.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
You can use the URL in this discussion post to see the final result of
**both** of your private LB submissions! Good job everyone!
