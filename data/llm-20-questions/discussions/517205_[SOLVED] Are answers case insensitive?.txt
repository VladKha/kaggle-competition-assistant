### [SOLVED] Are answers case insensitive?
Do we count an answer to be correct if it's the same regardless of letters
cases, or it needs no be **exactly** the same?
Like: keyword is "car" - LLM answer is "Car" - is it the correct answer or
not?

Yes answers are case insensitive  
In `llm_20_questions.py` you will find the function used:
    
    
    def keyword_guessed(guess: str) -> bool:
        def normalize(s: str) -> str:
          t = str.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation)
          return s.lower().replace("the", "").replace(" ", "").translate(t)
    
        if normalize(guess) == normalize(keyword):
          return True
        for s in alts:
          if normalize(s) == normalize(guess):
            return True
    
        return False
    
    
    content_copy
"THE CAR", "CAR", "Car," etc.. are correct answers for the keyword "car"
