### Suggestions for future LLM 20 Questions competitions
Dear Hosts and Kaggle, thanks for this interesting competition. It has been
observed that some agents ask **wrong questions** or provide **wrong answers**
, see for example this post:
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/519297>.
Example wrong questions are: "Are seeds a part of fruits? Can butterflies
fly?", and example wrong answers are: "What is the answer? What is your next
question?". These mostly result in failures independently of the skills of
teammate agents. Consequently, in the future, it might help to
  * integrate components that can measure the quality of answers provided or questions asked by agents, e.g., decrease the scores of agents whenever they "ask out of context" (out of game) questions or provide answers that can never be part of the game (e.g., "what is your next question?"),
  * decrease the frequency at which such agents play, e.g., once per week,
  * temporarily disable submissions for users submitting such agents, e.g., cannot submit within the next 3 days.
This will give the opportunity to best-performing agents to play against each
other, and help push the boundaries of 20 Questions games

Hi, although I haven't voted, I can say why I agree with downvoters. "Wrong"
questions or "wrong" guesses are already accounted by the reward. That's all
that is necessary to encourage efficient play. No special components trying to
detect unusual responses are necessary, no police officers banning solutions
for a week or disabling your account for misbehavior. I was very sorry to read
such suggestions. No doubt I would stay far away if such a competition was
ever going to take place.

Hi, thanks for your reply. By the way, I haven't suggested "banning people
from the competition", but giving them time (3 days was an estimate, it could
be less too) to build better solutions
