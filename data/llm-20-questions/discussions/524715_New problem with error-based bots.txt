### New problem with error-based bots
My first game on a newly submitted bot went like this:

I think this is a problem for most bots (my bot didn't return anything else
other than no and yes so it didn't error out) and should be punished in some
way. I am not sure about the way to punish something like this; however, this
could become more popular for the private LB.

I don't think they will do very well, so these types of submissions will work
their way to the bottom of the elo.  
as long as you check for yes/no as the answerer, you should be fine.


### [monkeyHyx](/monkeyhyx)
I think they are doing this to enhance the correctness of the answerer bot.


### [Andrew Tratz](/jademonk)
This is kind of interesting. Normally bots should be incentivized to
cooperate, but if a bot errors out its partner earns points. Not sure this is
a good game design, but it's the way it is. Since most, if not all, of the
public notebooks check for yes/no complying answers already I doubt this
strategy would yield very much.


### [Taizhuo Tang](/tztang)
I never thought about including a dedicated saboteur bot as one of the
submissions. Is there some sort of handshake so that the bot doesn't fail when
playing against itself?

If the answerer gets letter based questions incorrect then it will turn nasty.
