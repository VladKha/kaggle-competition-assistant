### Shouldn't everyone, every game have the same keyword to guess for all
games?
This will drop luckiness to get easy to guess keywords, and unluckiness to get
complicated keywords. What do you think? Or is this already implemented but in
different order games or something?
For example:  
Everyone's 1st game keyword: 'penguin'  
Everyone's 2nd game keyword: 'cell phone'  
Everyone's 3rd game keyword: 'elephant'  
And so on

Well, but this would convert the luck from "which keywords can you handle" to
"how well can you handle this one single keyword", so if the selected keyword
was "penguin" the team who always guesses "penguin" could win the competition,
and actually there is such a team.
IMO keywords are not the biggest source of randomness, it is pairings. While
any randomness should sort itself out in the long run, it turned out we are
not going to have any long run. The sigma is starting to reach half its
initial value, we're seeing the algorithm slowly "converging" which really is
just a frozen illusion of convergence.

I think he mistyped or at least his text is misinterpreted. I think he means
the keyword for all agents in the first round that runs should be one keyword.
In the next round, all agents will have a different keyword.


### [CchristoC](/cchristoc)
Yeah i mean say 1st game 'penguin' for all, 2nd game 'cell phone' for all,
etc.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
But there are no "rounds", the selection is kind of spontaneous.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
They could remake the keyword selection so that all agents run at the same
frequency. If Agent 1 is the first agent to run then Agent n is the last,
Agent 1 wouldn't rerun until Agent n runs. Agent 1 and Agent n will also have
the same keyword.


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
I fully agree with this suggestion.


### [VolodymyrBilyachat](/vovikdrg)
Probably not single word but kind of complexity. Like first round simple
words, then more complex and so on. But thats not that simple
