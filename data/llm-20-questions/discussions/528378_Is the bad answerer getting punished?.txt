### Is the bad answerer getting punished?
I've observed that many answerers provide incorrect answers to simple
questions about the keyword. This leads to the opposing team's asker/guesser
being unable to guess the keyword correctly. Unfortunately, this behavior is
incentivized since the opponent team is prevented from winning, and the team
with the poor answerer doesn't receive a negative score. I would request the
organizers that whenever a guesser successfully guesses the correct word, the
answerer paired with the guesser should receive a positive score instead of
the current negative score. This change would encourage teams to focus on
improving their answerers, in addition to their askers and guessers.

I'm not sure I understand you right. Can you explain how it would be in the
incentive of the answerer to not always do their best? If they answer badly,
most times they won't lose points because the guess rate is so low, but in the
end they will still lose some games and would basically never win games, so
there's still a clear advantage in answering as well as possible.

Hi [@raki21](https://www.kaggle.com/raki21),  
For example, consider two teams playing the game, Team A and Team B. Team A
has a bad answerer, while Team B has a good answerer. Both teams have equally
good askers and guessers. In this scenario, Team A is less likely to lose
because their bad answerer makes it difficult for Team B to guess the correct
word. Conversely, Team B's good answerer makes it more likely that Team A's
asker/guesser will guess the correct keyword. As a result, the team with a
good answerer (Team B) is more likely to lose and receive a negative score,
while the team with a bad answerer (Team A) will get a positive score.  
Thus, submitting a good guesser/asker and a bad answerer is less likely to
result in a negative score in any round, leading to a tie or a win. I am
unsure how having a good answerer provides an advantage. Please correct me if
I am wrong because if I am correct then decreasing the score of good answerer
does not make sense.

But the matches aren't between team x answerer and y asker vs y answerer and x
asker. It's completely randomized like team x + y vs team a + b. So your
answerer and asker can basically be treated as completely independent and your
agent score will be your average answerer and asker/guesser score


### [Puneet Khandelwal3476](/puneetkhandelwal3476)
I understand that in each round, there are four agents: x, y, a, and b. Two
will randomly become answerers, and two will become askers. Each asker will be
paired with an answerer to make a team. However, I am struggling to see how a
bad answerer is penalized in this setup. It seems that having a bad answerer
will not cause your team to lose if you are the answerer. The only time your
team can lose is if the other agent on your team is the answerer and they are
good. Therefore, if someone submits a bad answerer, how are they being
punished in this system?

Assume we do that. How do you evaluate good/bad answerer? Then how will you
ensure all eval are fair with 100% acc? Also, changing any rules at this point
would raise many ethical questions.


### [Puneet Khandelwal3476](/puneetkhandelwal3476)
We can increase the score of the answerer when the opponent's guesser is able
to guess the keyword correctly. As the guesser can only be correct if the
answerer has all/most questions correctly. However, in the competition, the
answerer is given a negative score when the opponent's guesser is able to
guess the keyword, which makes less sense. However, I agree that changing the
rules at this point won't be fair.
