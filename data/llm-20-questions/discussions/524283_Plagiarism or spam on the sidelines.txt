### Plagiarism or spam on the sidelines
Hello everybody, although it's a more general issue than just this
competition, it's taking place in this competition too, so I'd like to take
opportunity and bring it up. Certainly that's nothing new, it's a common
activity on Kaggle, copying notebooks without attribution and actually without
any purpose other than trying to score some petty points, I guess.

The notebooks are just verbatim copies from my notebook,
[@rturley](https://www.kaggle.com/rturley) and the Starter Notebook from
[@ryanholbrook](https://www.kaggle.com/ryanholbrook), not even forked properly
and interestingly all of them have +2 upvotes for a starter. Certainly not a
big crime, but I think it affects the quality of Kaggle experience, not so
much for the authors as for many other decent users. Especially when
proliferating. Another downside is that it tends to devaluate people's
authentic effort and contributions.
I had rised this issue before, long story short, perhaps such a spam issue (or
the related multiple account issue) could be an interesting topic for a
competition in itself, coz manually reporting this is a rather unsatisfactory
solution in my view.
Good luck by the way!

Thanks for pointing this out. While copying/forking is a nice compliment, it
is kind of awkward that these are exact copies without adding any unique
improvements or referencing the source.
I think part of the reason this happens is that Kaggle's default "Hotness"
sorting heavily prioritizes recently submitted notebooks. It creates an
incentive for someone to attract attention by copying older notebooks with
lots of upvotes that no longer appear near the top and then resubmitting.
It might be nice if Kaggle were to change their "Hotness" sort to prioritize
lines of new code not already in the public notebooks.

Each topic and each code notebook has a report, you can react like Kaggle
