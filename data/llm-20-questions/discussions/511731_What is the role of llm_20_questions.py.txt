### What is the role of llm_20_questions.py
I am having trouble understanding the role of the input .py file when thinking
of this competition in context and the way that a submission should be
formatted.
Do the agents defined in the input notebook override any prompts set in our
submissions?
Should we be referencing this input file during agent creation?
I apologize if the answer is painfully obvious, I am trying to learn here.

You don't need to worry about `llm_20_questions.py`, it's part of the
environment to run the game. You need to implement `agent_fn` function, e.g.:
    
    
    def agent_fn(obs, cfg):
        if obs.turnType == "ask":
            response = "Is it a duck?"
        elif obs.turnType == "answer":
            response = "no"
        elif obs.turnType == "guess":
            response = "two ducks"
        return response
