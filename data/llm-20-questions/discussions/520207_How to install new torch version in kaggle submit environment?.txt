### How to install new torch version in kaggle submit environment?
Has anyone successfully installed the new torch version when submit?  
i try to install torch 2.3.1 when submit but torch version always is 2.1.2, my
submit file like:
    
    
    %%writefile submission/main.py
    import os
    import subprocess
    
    KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH = "/kaggle_simulations/agent/"
    KAGGLE_DATA_PATH = "/kaggle_simulations/agent/"
    if not os.path.exists(KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH):
        KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH = '/kaggle/working/'
        KAGGLE_DATA_PATH = "/kaggle/input/"
    
    subprocess.run(f'pip install --no-index --find-links {KAGGLE_DATA_PATH}torch_whl torch==2.3.1', shell=True, check=True, capture_output = True)
    print('ok torch')
    import torch
    print('torch', torch.__version__) # stuck in 2.1.2
    
    
    content_copy
then agent log:
    
    
    [[{"duration": 98.399694, "stdout": "ok torch
    torch 2.1.2
    
    ok torch
    torch 2.1.2
    
    ", "stderr": "Traceback (most recent call last):

I ran into the same problem and believe it's due to the environment already
importing transformers here <https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-
environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/llm_20_questions.py>
and therefore also importing torch already as a dependency.
Since the torch module is already loaded in the Python interpreter your import
does not actually import the new version. I tried importlib's reload and
IPythons deep reload with no success. Did you manage do find a solution?


### [mxmm2123](/mxmm2123)
This is also why we can't use a newer model. That clear llm_20_questions.py
file always runs before the main.py file, and the main.py file was compiled
before running, so we can't do anything(at least for me).

Hi [@mxmm2123](https://www.kaggle.com/mxmm2123)
[@vmorelli](https://www.kaggle.com/vmorelli) ,  
I currently still using older models, with the transformers issue I think we
can only wait for support from the host.
