### [FIXED] - The Top 9 LB is the result Errors
On May 29 at 14:00 UTC, I noticed the top 9 agents on the LB were all the
result of gaining points from their teammate throwing an error. (The top 9
teams at 14:00 UTC were: Dapeng, Agney, Neel, Mitul, Neige, Agney, Gol-eel,
tr, Mesmerized).
For each of the top 9 agents on LB, I reviewed their most recent game where
they achieved positive points. I display these below. In each case, they
received points because their teammate errored.
Is this the intended scoring mechanism?
[@develra](https://www.kaggle.com/develra)
[@addisonhoward](https://www.kaggle.com/addisonhoward) Should luck be the
reason teams climb the LB?
IMO, when an agent throws an error, I suggest that the defective bot loses
points and all 3 other bots ignore the game. (i.e. the other 3 bots get zero
points and they immediately get a new game to replace the erroneous game).
Guessing the keyword is difficult and there shouldn't be an easy way to gain
lots of free points. (And on private LB, guessing will be even more difficult
without a list of keywords).

### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
UPDATE. I notice the same thing happening on May 30th at 14:00 UTC. The new
first place jumped up to LB 660 because their teammate had an error. This
destabilizes the leaderboard because now the original top LB bots will play
with and against these bots whose true score is under 600.

### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
The creators of this competition really need to fix this quickly.üòë


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
I am looking through the top 25 LB and out of the top 25 11 of them are
boosted by errors.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Yes it is very disruptive. Because new games are organized by bots being
paired to play with bots of the same level. When error bots get boosted
unnaturally, they begin playing with and against the real top bots. Then they
cause the real top bots to drop out of the top. This makes the LB very
unstable.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
These are the errors in the top 10 (1, 5, 8, 9):

### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Yes, I agree. I have gotten to the top 5 many times in the span of this
competition (I am even 3rd place right now but don't expect to stay here for
long) and almost every time I fall off later I check who I was matched up with
it shows to be an error agent which lasts in top 5 for a few mins or hours but
then drags down some other high-ranking bot with then. This would not be a
problem if it did not affect the top of the LB. However this is pretty much a
sabotage agent
(<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/507961)>.
And the loss function should be fixed ASAP.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Hi, the first place error bot is mine I have no idea why it is erroring I am
fi I am finding out now thank you for alerting me to this. I had no intention
of "illegally" giving top places points.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
My bot is also 3rd üò≠. I have decided to submit three of my older bots to
overwrite the offending error bots. This is my temporary solution since I do
not want to be contributing to an unfair leaderboard.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Hi OminousDude. There is no need to apoligize. Everybody's bots will make
errors from time to time as we develop solutions. Earlier versions of my bots
had errors and each day I remove errors and improve my bots. So don't worry
about submitting bots with errors. Continue to try new things and submit
whatever you want.
I think the competition metric should be updated so that bot errors do not
help other bots.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Yes, that would be the optimal solution but again the temporary solution is
for me to remove the bots until their errors are fixed. Thank you for
informing me on the issues of my bots. Because it was very weird that my agent
improves almost all the time more or less +10 each time it goes up against
another bot; however, its score is still always low.

### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
I guess the errors were just holding it down or something because as you can
see in the image above my agent performs really well in most cases.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Note that you can download game logs for your bot games. The log will show you
the error. Also your bot can use `print()` command and it will write to game
logs. Only you can see game logs pertaining to your bot.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Ok, thank you very much!


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
The button to download logs is in bottom left. This button only appears when
you are viewing your own games. See image below:

### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
Thank you very much! I did not know that was what it was used for. Thank you!üòÅ

Taking a look at this now, thanks for reporting.


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff

A fix for this should be rolling out tomorrow. The reward when an agent fails
after this should be net zero. For example the failing agent might get -21 and
the other three get an average of +7 each.
Penalizing the failing agent is important to keep the leaderboards clear and
not allow a "error on purpose" strategy to exist. (eg if an agent hasn't
guessed after X rounds and knows the average game at their level is X + 1,
they could error on purpose if there was no penalty for doing so).


### [Bovard Doerschuk-Tiberi](/bovard)
Kaggle Staff

This is rolled out now


### [Giba](/titericz)
I support what Chris says. I observed the same behaviour in LB, agent errors
distribute free points to other agents.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) I noticed that Mohammad just received
130 points (on June 4th) when his teammate (me Chris) errored. Other teams on
the LB need to successfully win 5+ games to get 130 points (which requires the
difficult accomplishment of guessing 5+ words correctly versus the lucky
result of teammate error).
FYI, Kaggle said they fixed awarding points for teammates of error teams but
this doesn't look fixed:

Yeah I saw that as well. Looks like there was a bug if the agent errors on the
last round of the competition. This has been fixed in
<https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments/pull/275>


### [Andres H. Zapke](/andreshzapke)
Hello!
One question, where does the answerer even come from? Is this supposed to be a
separate LLM that has to be trained independently?  
And did I get it right, that because the answerer is not answering correctly,
the "correct" guesses aren't being graded accordingly?


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Each match has 4 Kaggle teams which are Questioner + Answerer versus
Questioner + Answerer. So it is 2 vs. 2.
Each Answerer knows the correct answer and responds to their teammate the
Questioner.


### [Andres H. Zapke](/andreshzapke)
Yes, but the Answerer cannot be a hard-coded bot, since it has to interpret
the question correctly. I thought he is responsible for grading our
"Questioner LLMs", so I think it should be universal to all games.
Question: How and why does the Answerer respond to its teammate and not to the
enemy Questioner?
