### Help! Stuck in Kaggle's file import
of submission folder, not inside the lib folder.
So I run the game from my Kaggle notebook with `game_output =
env.run(agents=[simple_agent, simple_agent, simple_agent ,
"/kaggle/working/submission/main.py"])` and everything works until now.
However now "main.py" needs some methods of the "gemma" module. I tried
importing them with `sys.path.insert(0, "/kaggle/working/submission/lib")
sys.path.insert(0, "./lib")` and `from gemma.config import *` but I always
get: "No module named 'gemma.config'".
I confirmed that gemma has an "**init**.py" file and I can't figure out how to
import its methods into my main. Any tips appreciated!!
