### An interesting discussion has been deleted?
There was an interesting discussion going on today, but suddenly it has
disappeared.. Confusing.. I presume deleted by the author?
[@robertotessera](https://www.kaggle.com/robertotessera) what happened? I
think your post was very interesting and the discussion was equally
interesting. People already have put effort in responding to your doubts and
questions. While you have the right to delete your threads, please next time
consider that others have already engaged in the discussion.
