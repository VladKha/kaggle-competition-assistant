### I don't mean to be a snitch but...
I was looking through the leaderboard and there are 2 of these accounts. Isn't
this against kaggle
rules?![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-

Kaggle will take care of cases that violate compliance rules at the end of the
competition. The final leaderboard will be sanitized and then prizes will be
distributed [@max1mum](https://www.kaggle.com/max1mum)
