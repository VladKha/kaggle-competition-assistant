### Some competitors still have 3 agents active.
While most participants that are actively submitting have 2 agents active,
older submissions still have 3 agents active (at least this is displayed on
the leaderboard). Is this a bug?

I just ran an update to disable any third agents, all teams should now have 2
agents


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
Thanks for the feedback, but it seems it didn't work


### [Regis Vargas](/regisvargas)
But from what I understand, according to the rules, the last three agents
would be competing until the end. Wouldn't that be it?

[@regisvargas](https://www.kaggle.com/regisvargas) Changed my brother, game
update


### [blackbun](/blackbun)
I guess the number of active agents changes once you submit a new agent after
the rule update.


### [HelloGPX](/peixiangong)
I think so, as I haven't update code for a long time, I still have 3 active
agents.


### [Regis Vargas](/regisvargas)
This is strange because my second to last agent is disabled, and he was
submitted 15 days ago.


### [Songling](/wolfmedal)
It should be updated after the game. Now we have six agents
