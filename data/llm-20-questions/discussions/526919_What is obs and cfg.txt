### What is obs and cfg
I get that it's the observation and configuration but where can we see what
attributes they actually have?

You can try offline game e.g. see the end of this notebook  
<https://www.kaggle.com/code/kasafumi/llm20q-qwen2-7b-it>
Then, you can print to see what's inside the Observation class

That's a good question tbh, I think the specifications aren't great and a lot
is just left for the user to find/ask on their own.  
I've used this template (from <https://www.kaggle.com/code/khahuras/offline-
policy-questioner-agent):>  
`class Observation(BaseModel): step: int role: t.Literal["guesser",
"answerer"] turnType: t.Literal["ask", "answer", "guess"] keyword: str
category: str questions: list[str] answers: list[str] guesses: list[str]
remainingOverageTime: float`
