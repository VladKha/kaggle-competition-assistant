### Why do scores start at 600?
I joined this competition a couple of days ago and I was wondering why all
scores start on 600 and not 500 or just 0? could someone please explain this
to me?

It's explained in the competition overview
([www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/overview/evaluation](www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/overview/evaluation))
Basically, they assume new entries have a skill rating that is centered on 600
with a wide range of uncertainty. As the agent wins or loses, the skill rating
moves up or down and the range of uncertainty narrows.
