### Can we reset the entire leaderboard?
Currently, the leaderboard is clogged up by old (and great) location-only
models that will slowly move down. However, this will also affect other models
that have adjusted to the changes. As of right now, it is much harder to
compare scores because of all of the half-keyword models. Is it possible to
return scores to 600 or is this not possible to achieve for the competition
hosts? [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard)

The current LB is not very meaningful, but in my opinion resetting would not
make it better, or fix anything.
I believe our hosts are watching closely and will adjust the ranking algorithm
to ensure convergence in the final stage, which doesn't seem to be very robust
at the moment. One particular issue appears to be a "pit of dumbness" down
there around 600 and below (no offense to any cute agents always saying
"yes"), and it's difficult to get out of there even if your agent is
relatively smart (e.g. it can play reasonably against itself.)
Let's understand the reluctance of the hosts to react, regarding any issue.
Any intervention or unexpected change works against reliability and trust, and
is potentially disrespectful to someone's effort already made, so the
justification must be rock solid.


### [RS Turley](/rturley)
I agree with you: the "pit of dumbness" is a big challenge. It is relatively
difficult to win games when you are paired with a partner in the 600-range.
The solution to that may fall on us, as a community of competitors, to get
more intelligent bots in the competition!
That said, I really appreciate that a new submission gets a dozen or more
matches during their first day, so there is a reasonable chance to escape that
pit of dumbness with just one win.


### [OminousDude](/max1mum)
I have been stuck in this "pit" for my last 7 submissions. I doubt my model is
the problem since it works very well against itself in validation but I hate
the only yes/no bots.

Thanks for bringing this up! To address this we are adding some "random"
episodes where agents will be matched with anyone from the leaderboard.
Initially this should be about 10% of the total games, and we will adjust as
needed. This should allow agents an opportunity to play with higher rated
opponents enough to break the deadlock.
EDIT: looks like there is a bug with this functionality. It is currently
disabled until we can get that fixed.

This change should be rolled out now.


### [Melinda](/melindaweathers)
Nice! Previously my three very similar agents had vastly different scores
(different by 200 points), but over the last few days they have converged to
nearly the same score, so this change seems to be making a difference!


### [Matthew S Farmer](/matthewsfarmer)
I second this request.
