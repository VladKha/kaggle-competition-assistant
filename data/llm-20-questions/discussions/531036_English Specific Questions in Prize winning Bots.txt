### English Specific Questions in Prize winning Bots
Refer to LLM 20 Question Competition which just completed today.  
<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/>
Congratulations to all winners and top performing teams in this competition.
This is a very interesting competition and generated very insightful
discussions and coding.
I observe that many prize winning and top ranking bots are just asking
questions specific to English language.  
Examples :
  1. Does the keyword (in lowercase) precede \"lake salmon\" in alphabetical order?"
  2. Does the keyword (in lowercase) precede \"eomart discount\" in alphabetical order?
  3. Does the keyword (in lowercase) precede \"lake salmon\" in alphabetical order?
  4. Does the keyword (in lowercase) precede \"damage control\" in alphabetical order?
I think same bots may not work if the 20 Questions game is in different
language. The bots have to be completely reprogrammed altogether.  
From the description of the competition by organizers:  
_This competition will evaluate LLMs on key skills like deductive reasoning,
efficient information gathering through targeted questioning, and
collaboration between paired agents. It also presents a constrained setting
requiring creativity and strategy with a limited number of guesses .Success
will demonstrate LLMs' capacity for**not just answering questions** , but also
asking insightful questions, performing logical inference, and quickly
narrowing down possibilities._
The questions are not insightful, the bots are just using direct questions.
Maybe this strategy is giving good scores and higher rankings through quickly
narrowing down possibilities. But these techniques are very specific to
English but may not be generalized to other languages.
Welcome comments from competition participants for my views.
