### `keyword.py` only contains places, no people, no things
Hi !
I expected `keywords.py` to contain examples of places, people and things.
Instead, it only contains places in three categories : 'country', 'city', and
'landmark'.
What am I missing here?

They will add more any day now but for right now there are only places.

Is there any mention of this somewhere? I can't seem to find it.
