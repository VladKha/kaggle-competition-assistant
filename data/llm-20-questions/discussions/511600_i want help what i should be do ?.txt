For learning, I would attempt to prompt and constrain a pre-trained agent like
Gemma. The starter notebook can help you with that. Even a well-trained LLM
has trouble with deterministic thinking and game-like constraints. This is a
hard competition. Don't take my word for it, find the best LLM chat you have
access to and attempt to play 20 questions with it.
