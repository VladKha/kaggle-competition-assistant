### The best score of each team on LB is only the best of the most recent 3
submissions
I have a bot with 796 score which should place 2nd. But when I submitted some
new submissions, those pushed my 796-score bot out of the LB ranking.
Is this what we should expect? I guess an absolute best score should be
displayed there on LB.  
And how are the final bots selected for scoring at the end?

There were significant problems with keeping all submissions active (compute,
leaderboard implications) so our current system only keeps the most recent
three submissions.
When the submission deadline hits, only your active agents will be considered
for the final leaderboard

Thanks for clarifying. However it is still strange if Kaggle doesn’t allow us
to choose which bots to operate. Day to day experiment and submission can be
plentiful, and selecting different bot versions can spread a long period of
time.

Thanks for the feedback!
Arbitrary switching agents in and out causes a few different vectors to game
the system so enabling that is unlikely.
We have considered the ability to mark a submission as "evergreen" so it
doesn't get disabled (but still counts towards your total). How does that
sound to you?

I’ve been heavily involved in 3 past simulation comps on Kaggle, but the
notion of only limiting to 3 active agents is new to me. It will cause
problems either way you allow users to choose submissions or not.  
Auto disabling old bots will leave their unrealistic and unupdated high or low
score on the LB. As well it restricts the users development progress if
somebody wants to submit and track many of their bots.
Allowing users to switch agents means allowing them to “game” the system.
A smarter way would be automatically disable only bots those have a certain
amount of games resulting “error”. I believe they are plentiful. Or increasing
active limit bots from 3 to 5.
Marking a sub to evergreen can’t be reversed? If it can how is it different
than freely allowing users to choose subs? If it can’t the. i guess nobody
dare to use it

The deactivated agents no longer show up on the leaderboard.
What we saw in previous competitions in that a team might submit 100 agents
that are all roughly the same and would sit as a "filter" on the leaderboard.
An agent would need to be able to beat that strategy to pass up that point in
the leaderboard because the propensity to be paired against one of the hundred
was so high.

No, you'd be able to go in and chose which agents you want as evergreen. For
example maybe you keep your highest rated solution and evergreen and let the
others be disabled.
However once an agent is deactivated, you can't bring it back.

I think that this is due to the fact, that one can only have three active
agents. Since there is (currently) no way to select which agents are
evaluated, **only the 3 most recent submissions** keep participating. Also, as
the score of an agent (in some way) depends on all other agents on the
leaderboard and the exact scoring mechanism used at the time, it would not be
correct to take the maximum score of all agents ever submitted if the agent
corresponding to the maximum is no longer re-evaluated constantly.
Still, I totally agree that **there should be a way to select which agents to
participate in the leaderboard games**.
