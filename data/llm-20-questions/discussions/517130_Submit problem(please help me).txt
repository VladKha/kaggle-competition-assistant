### Submit problem(please help me)
I am a beginner in this competition.  
I just tried to submit a notebook but it's keep saying "Validation Episode
failed(Error)".  
I also try to read the log after failure, but the log is empty  
What is the problem?

I am having the same issue, and it does not seem related to my code or to the
agent's behavior.  
This is the log I see from one of the agent:
`[[{"duration": 0.002077, "stdout": "", "stderr": "Traceback (most recent call
last):\n File \"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-
packages/kaggle_environments/agent.py\", line 43, in get_last_callable\n

Maybe anyone can help? [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard)

There are two logs: Agent 0 and Agent 1. Are you sure that you check both of
them?

Me too… Help me…

The last time I encountered "Validation Episode failed (Error)" was because I
removed the restrictions on the answers "yes" and "no" during debugging, which
resulted in the error being thrown when the agent answered other answers
during submission. In addition, you also need to pay attention to whether the
run timeout, whether the number of characters exceeds the limit, etc.
