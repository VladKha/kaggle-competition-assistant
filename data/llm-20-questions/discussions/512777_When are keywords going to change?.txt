### When are keywords going to change?
Earlier we were told that they would change first week of June, but as you can
see we haven't had this. Last week we were told
> EDIT: This will now roll out early next week, sorry for the delay!
But it is no the end of this week when will the changes be made? And if you
can answer what is the reason for this delay?

New words should roll out today

I believe keywords have been changed since the `keywords.py` file now
includes: `country`, `city`, and `landmark` instead of the initial categories:
`person`, `place`, and `thing`.
Below, is an excerpt of the file:
    
    
    """List of keywords for 20 Questions."""
    
    KEYWORDS_JSON = """
    [
      {
        "category": "country",
        "words": [
          {
            "keyword": "afghanistan",
            "alts": []
          },
    
    
    content_copy

Keywords were always country, city, and landmark and were never person, place,
and thing. They were promising to add person and object soon.


### [Guillaume Gilles](/guillaumegilles)
Forgive me for my confusion.
If I understood correctly, categories are now: `place` and `things`.
