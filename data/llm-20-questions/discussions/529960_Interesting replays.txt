### Interesting replays
There was a thread with absurd replays, but I don't want to warm it up with
not necessarily absurd replays. Just interesting in any way.
In [this
episode](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-
episode-55833168) all the questions and guesses are identical. The answers are
also identical presumably because of that particular keyword and the fact that
both LLMs were similar. Well, perhaps both guessers used the same public
notebook? Or the same LLM with very low temperature? But then their prompts
would have to be very similar, too.

Sensational! c-number's agent derailed by yukky_maru's long question..

### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
I think the questions are copied from top agents (I saw some agents using the
same question as C-number when he was top 1 for almost a month), but I have no
explanation for the identical answers, it's quite strange.


### [c-number](/cnumber)
It's kind of the other way around; I copied some questions from the winning
agents of the public LB.


### [Jonathan Chan](/jonathanchan)
How to "copy" from the top agents such as C-number? You mean trying to
implement imitation learning by extracting the game data? This is a common
practice in many past simulation competitions. Identical questions and answers
are weird as LLMs are inherently stochastic. Both teams need to set their
Temperature to effectively 0 which is definitely not the norm. Another
possibility is the two agents may be rule-based with an identical keyword
list. I don't recall seeing any such publicly shared notebook or discussion
threads though.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
I copied some questions from c-number, too, but I didn't copy any answers.


### [torino](/pnmanh2123)
[@jonathanchan](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanchan) "copy" in here means we
fixed some first questions to narrow the domain space of keywords like the
first is always "Is the keyword things?", it not LLM gen questions.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
[@torino](https://www.kaggle.com/torino) not only identical questions, they
obviously could be copied, but also identical order and guesses.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
My agent just had a special match. Please, let me share to illustrate some
points. The pit is real, it takes an opportunity to play with good agents to
get out of there, or self-play. That's perhaps one of those 10% cross-ranking
games which were meant to help agents get out of the pit. But is 10% enough in
our context, to give enough opportunity for all stuck agents? I'm not sure.
Secondly I'm really proud that my alpha could guess the keyword even though it
was not in its dictionary. This is the technique that was mentioned earlier
regarding RA-G. [@cdeotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte)

PS. The other team kept guessing "eiffel tower", so.. no apologies this time.


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
Nice guess! Thanks for giving my bot a win and boosting my bot's score by
`+199`!


### [JK-Piece](/jeannkouagou)
This is called resurrection:)


### [Chris Deotte](/cdeotte)
haha, yes. My bot got out of "The Pit" ðŸ˜€
