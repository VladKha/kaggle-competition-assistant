### Keywords used for final evaluation
I know this has been asked before, but with 2 days left in the competition it
would be great if we could get some clarification regarding the list of
keywords that will be used after the submissions close.
It was only mentioned explicitly that the keywords in keywords.py will not be
used, but as has been pointed out in other discussions there are larger public
lists of keywords scraped from the current games being played. Will these
words be in the final keywords list? This seems to me like a pretty important
piece of information regarding the rules of the game.

It's been asked so many times indeed. Nothing new has been scraped that would
change the last
[update](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/523198).


### [Mitsutani](/dmitsutani)
I still don't think it's obvious from the phrasing in the post or any of the
official responses that any of the scraped keywords won't be used. All that
seems very explicit to me is that the keywords in keywords.py won't.

but certainly our interpretation may be different… maybe the official
clarification is already on the way.. ,)


### [Mitsutani](/dmitsutani)
It does sounds like the scraped words will be swapped, just think it would be
good to make it very explicit since it's a pretty important detail. But
hopefully you're right :)
