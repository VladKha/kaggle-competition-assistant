### Crowdsourcing Variance in LB score
I imagine some people have submitted copies or very similar pipelines, because
it was clear that variance would be high and when there is so much luck
involved it makes sense to stay close to your strongest approach and submit it
twice.
Our submissions aren't exact copies but pretty similar and are currently at
~1010 and ~920.
Would be interesting to see additional score comparisons!

That's the current score correlation. It's a bit better than the previous one,
the coefficient went up from 0.25 to 0.35. It seems both submissions are high
for a few top players, but many players around 1000 have their other
submission much lower.

[@khahuras](https://www.kaggle.com/khahuras) I have a question, the scatter
plot above is random with respect to the order of scores, i.e. the x and y
axis. But if I sort the scores so that score 1 is always the better one, it
looks very different (obviously) and the correlation is 0.66. What's the
correct approach?

### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
I guess when sorting you accidentally decrease variance of each variable,
causing corr to rise?


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
But only the order (score_1, score_2) is sorted for each player, ~~variance is
not affected~~ … actually yes, my misunderstanding, variance is affected


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
I mean corr is something like “how likely x is high when y high and vice
versa”. When not sorting x spread from 600 to 1200 , same as y. After sort x
spread from 900 to 1200, y spread from 600 to 1000. So both var x and y
decrease. It boosts corr significantly. Sorting looks better though imho,
because we want to know “how likely the worse submission correlate with the
better submission for each team”


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
Thanks a lot, LLM also said that by sorting the order of scores some bias is
introduced… well, maybe it makes sense, the columns are no longer independent,
but modified in a specific way.


### [Andrew Tratz](/jademonk)
Right now I've got two exactly identical bots with 1178 and 678 scores


### [Kha Vo](/khahuras)
I have 2 similar bots, not identical though. One is 1137 and the other 1098


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
I think the tornado has helped to shake the ranking, but it most probably
didn't eliminate the pit, so it's still possible to be trapped. It's difficult
to say what else has been changed except the sigma reset. If you look at my
post about the pit, there are a few options to improve the convergence, but
which options are feasible to apply is really hard to say without knowing more
details about the current algorithm, the match-making, and without a better
model of the skill distribution.


### [loh-maa](/lohmaa)
I have two identical bots except one is using alpha in pro-active mode.. It
was trailing and stuck in the pit for the most part, but got out yesterday and
now is well ahead of the non-alpha bot.


### [Garvin Bhati](/bhatiji)
Yes, I have two bots that are fairly identical with minor changes, and their
current individual scores are 787 and 622. Due to the nature of the game
sometimes they can have significant difference, such as if one fails and the
other guesses right on the same day, but I've typically seen them with roughly
the same scores.
