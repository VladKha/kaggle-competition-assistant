87,"What are some suggested ways to utilize large language models (LLMs) effectively for this competition, besides using together.ai?","Experimenting with various system prompts, such as instructing the LLM to act as a math expert and provide only the result without intermediate steps, is recommended. Additionally, incorporating instructions to remove units or extraneous information within the system prompt is advised."
88,Has anyone else encountered inconsistencies between the provided answers and the expected format based on the question descriptions within the training dataset?,"I've sampled a few random examples from the training set and already encountered errors in the answers. Has anyone else noticed similar issues? I hope the test set is validated more thoroughly to ensure accurate evaluation.
for example, question id 9294 : the question asks: Which routes should the traveler choose to visit all four museums while spending the least amount of money on tickets?
In the answer, indicate any one set of route numbers without spaces, commas, or other additional symbols.  
but the answer is actually the total cost, rather than the path."
