### Concerns About Errors in Training Set
I've sampled a few random examples from the training set and already
encountered errors in the answers. Has anyone else noticed similar issues? I
hope the test set is validated more thoroughly to ensure accurate evaluation.
for example, question id 9294 : the question asks: Which routes should the
traveler choose to visit all four museums while spending the least amount of
money on tickets?
In the answer, indicate any one set of route numbers without spaces, commas,
or other additional symbols.  
but the answer is actually the total cost, rather than the path.
